   <p><span id="f000002">During the time that France was divided into provinces (or dukedoms as they were called) there reigned in one of these provinces an usurper,</span> 
    <span id="f000003">who had deposed and banished his elder brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000004">the lawful duke.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000005">The duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000006">who was thus driven from his dominions,</span> 
    <span id="f000007">retired with a few faithful followers to the forest of Arden;</span> 
    <span id="f000008">and here the good duke lived with his loving friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000009">who had put themselves into a voluntary exile for his sake,</span> 
    <span id="f000010">while their land and revenues enriched the false usurper;</span> 
    <span id="f000011">and custom soon made the life of careless ease they led here more sweet to them than the pomp and uneasy splendour of a courtier’s life.</span> 
    <span id="f000012">Here they lived like the old Robin Hood of England,</span> 
    <span id="f000013">and to this forest many noble youths daily resorted from the court,</span> 
    <span id="f000014">and did fleet the time carelessly,</span> 
    <span id="f000015">as they did who lived in the golden age.</span> 
    <span id="f000016">In the summer they lay along under the fine shade of the large forest trees,</span> 
    <span id="f000017">marking the playful sports of the wild deer;</span> 
    <span id="f000018">and so fond were they of these poor dappled fools,</span> 
    <span id="f000019">who seemed to be the native inhabitants of the forest,</span> 
    <span id="f000020">that it grieved them to be forced to kill them to supply themselves with venison for their food.</span> 
    <span id="f000021">When the cold winds of winter made the duke feel the change of his adverse fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000022">he would endure it patiently,</span> 
    <span id="f000023">and say:</span> 
    <span id="f000024">«These chilling winds which blow upon my body are true counsellors;</span> 
    <span id="f000025">they do not flatter,</span> 
    <span id="f000026">but represent truly to me my condition;</span> 
    <span id="f000027">and though they bite sharply,</span> 
    <span id="f000028">their tooth is nothing like so keen as that of unkindness and ingratitude.</span> 
    <span id="f000029">I find that howsoever men speak against adversity,</span> 
    <span id="f000030">yet some sweet uses are to be extracted from it;</span> 
    <span id="f000031">like the jewel,</span> 
    <span id="f000032">precious for medicine,</span> 
    <span id="f000033">which is taken from the head of the venomous and despised toad.» In this manner did the patient duke draw a useful moral from everything that he saw;</span> 
    <span id="f000034">and by the help of this moralizing turn,</span> 
    <span id="f000035">in that life of his,</span> 
    <span id="f000036">remote from public haunts,</span> 
    <span id="f000037">he could find tongues in trees,</span> 
    <span id="f000038">books in the running brooks,</span> 
    <span id="f000039">sermons in stones,</span> 
    <span id="f000040">and good in everything.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000041">The banished duke had an only daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000042">named Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000043">whom the usurper,</span> 
    <span id="f000044">duke Frederick,</span> 
    <span id="f000045">when he banished her father,</span> 
    <span id="f000046">still retained in his court as a companion for his own daughter Celia.</span> 
    <span id="f000047">A strict friendship subsisted between these ladies,</span> 
    <span id="f000048">which the disagreement between their fathers did not in the least interrupt,</span> 
    <span id="f000049">Celia striving by every kindness in her power to make amends to Rosalind for the injustice of her own father in deposing the father of Rosalind;</span> 
    <span id="f000050">and whenever the thoughts of her father’s banishment,</span> 
    <span id="f000051">and her own dependence on the false usurper,</span> 
    <span id="f000052">made Rosalind melancholy,</span> 
    <span id="f000053">Celia’s whole care was to comfort and console her.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000054">One day,</span> 
    <span id="f000055">when Celia was talking in her usual kind manner to Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000056">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000057">«I pray you,</span> 
    <span id="f000058">Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000059">my sweet cousin,</span> 
    <span id="f000060">be merry,» a messenger entered from the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000061">to tell them that if they wished to see a wrestling match,</span> 
    <span id="f000062">which was just going to begin,</span> 
    <span id="f000063">they must come instantly to the court before the palace;</span> 
    <span id="f000064">and Celia,</span> 
    <span id="f000065">thinking it would amuse Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000066">agreed to go and see it.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000067">In those times wrestling,</span> 
    <span id="f000068">which is only practiced now by country clowns,</span> 
    <span id="f000069">was a favourite sport even in the courts of princes,</span> 
    <span id="f000070">and before fair ladies and princesses.</span> 
    <span id="f000071">To this wrestling match,</span> 
    <span id="f000072">therefore,</span> 
    <span id="f000073">Celia and Rosalind went.</span> 
    <span id="f000074">They found that it was likely to prove a very tragical sight;</span> 
    <span id="f000075">for a large and powerful man,</span> 
    <span id="f000076">who had been long practiced in the art of wrestling,</span> 
    <span id="f000077">and had slain many men in contests of this kind,</span> 
    <span id="f000078">was just going to wrestle with a very young man,</span> 
    <span id="f000079">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000080">from his extreme youth and inexperience in the art,</span> 
    <span id="f000081">the beholders all thought would certainly be killed.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000082">When the duke saw Celia and Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000083">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000084">«How now,</span> 
    <span id="f000085">daughter and niece,</span> 
    <span id="f000086">are you crept hither to see the wrestling?</span> 
    <span id="f000087">You will take little delight in it,</span> 
    <span id="f000088">there is such odds in the men:</span> 
    <span id="f000089">in pity to this young man,</span> 
    <span id="f000090">I would wish to persuade him from wrestling.</span> 
    <span id="f000091">Speak to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000092">ladies,</span> 
    <span id="f000093">and see if you can move him.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000094">The ladies were well pleased to perform this humane office,</span> 
    <span id="f000095">and first Celia entreated the young stranger that he would desist from the attempt;</span> 
    <span id="f000096">and then Rosalind spoke so kindly to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000097">and with such feeling consideration for,</span> 
    <span id="f000098">the danger he was about to undergo,</span> 
    <span id="f000099">that instead of being persuaded by her gentle words to forego his purpose,</span> 
    <span id="f000100">all his thoughts were bent to distinguish himself by his courage in this lovely lady’s eyes.</span> 
    <span id="f000101">He refused the request of Celia and Rosalind in such graceful and modest words,</span> 
    <span id="f000102">that they felt still more concern for him;</span> 
    <span id="f000103">he concluded his refusal with saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000104">«I am sorry to deny such fair and excellent ladies anything.</span> 
    <span id="f000105">But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial,</span> 
    <span id="f000106">wherein if I be conquered there is one shamed that was never gracious;</span> 
    <span id="f000107">if I am killed,</span> 
    <span id="f000108">there is one dead that is willing to die;</span> 
    <span id="f000109">I shall do my friends no wrong,</span> 
    <span id="f000110">for I have none to lament me;</span> 
    <span id="f000111">the world no injury,</span> 
    <span id="f000112">for in it I have nothing;</span> 
    <span id="f000113">for I only fill up a place in the world which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000114">And now the wrestling match began.</span> 
    <span id="f000115">Celia wished the young stranger might not be hurt;</span> 
    <span id="f000116">but Rosalind felt most for him.</span> 
    <span id="f000117">The friendless state which he said he was in,</span> 
    <span id="f000118">and that he wished to die,</span> 
    <span id="f000119">made Rosalind think that he was like herself,</span> 
    <span id="f000120">unfortunate;</span> 
    <span id="f000121">and she pitied him so much,</span> 
    <span id="f000122">and so deep an interest she took in his danger while he was wrestling,</span> 
    <span id="f000123">that she might almost be said at that moment to have fallen in love with him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000124">The kindness shown this unknown youth by these fair and noble ladies gave him courage and strength,</span> 
    <span id="f000125">so that he performed wonders;</span> 
    <span id="f000126">and in the end completely conquered his antagonist,</span> 
    <span id="f000127">who was so much hurt,</span> 
    <span id="f000128">that for a while he was unable to speak or move.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000129">The duke Frederick was much pleased with the courage and skill shown by this young stranger;</span> 
    <span id="f000130">and desired to know his name and parentage,</span> 
    <span id="f000131">meaning to take him under his protection.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000132">The stranger said his name was Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000133">and that he was the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000134">Sir Rowland de Boys,</span> 
    <span id="f000135">the father of Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000136">had been dead some years;</span> 
    <span id="f000137">but when he was living,</span> 
    <span id="f000138">he had been a true subject and dear friend of the banished duke;</span> 
    <span id="f000139">therefore,</span> 
    <span id="f000140">when Frederick heard Orlando was the son of his banished brother’s friend,</span> 
    <span id="f000141">all his liking for this brave young man was changed into displeasure,</span> 
    <span id="f000142">and he left the place in very ill humour.</span> 
    <span id="f000143">Hating to hear the very name of any of his brother’s friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000144">and yet still admiring the valour of the youth,</span> 
    <span id="f000145">he said,</span> 
    <span id="f000146">as he went out,</span> 
    <span id="f000147">that he wished Orlando had been the son of any other man.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000148">Rosalind was delighted to hear that her new favourite was the son of her father’s old friend;</span> 
    <span id="f000149">and she said to Celia:</span> 
    <span id="f000150">«My father loved Sir Rowland de Boys,</span> 
    <span id="f000151">and if I had known this young man was his son,</span> 
    <span id="f000152">I would have added tears to my entreaties before he should have ventured.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000153">The ladies then went up to him;</span> 
    <span id="f000154">and seeing him abashed by the sudden displeasure shown by the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000155">they spoke kind and encouraging words to him;</span> 
    <span id="f000156">and Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000157">when they were going away,</span> 
    <span id="f000158">turned back to speak some more civil things to the brave young son of her father’s old friend;</span> 
    <span id="f000159">and taking a chain from off her neck,</span> 
    <span id="f000160">she said:</span> 
    <span id="f000161">«Gentleman,</span> 
    <span id="f000162">wear this for me.</span> 
    <span id="f000163">I am out of suits with fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000164">or I would give you a more valuable present.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000165">When the ladies were alone,</span> 
    <span id="f000166">Rosalind’s talk being still of Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000167">Celia began to perceive her cousin had fallen in love with the handsome young wrestler,</span> 
    <span id="f000168">and she said to Rosalind:</span> 
    <span id="f000169">«Is it possible you should fall in love so suddenly?» Rosalind replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000170">«The duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000171">my father,</span> 
    <span id="f000172">loved his father dearly.» «But,» said Celia,</span> 
    <span id="f000173">«does it therefore follow that you should love his son dearly?</span> 
    <span id="f000174">for then I ought to hate him,</span> 
    <span id="f000175">for my father hated his father;</span> 
    <span id="f000176">yet I do not hate Orlando.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000177">Frederick being enraged at the sight of Sir Rowland de Boys’ son,</span> 
    <span id="f000178">which reminded him of the many friends the banished duke had among the nobility,</span> 
    <span id="f000179">and having been for some time displeased with his niece,</span> 
    <span id="f000180">because the people praised her for her virtues,</span> 
    <span id="f000181">and pitied her for her good father’s sake,</span> 
    <span id="f000182">his malice suddenly broke out against her;</span> 
    <span id="f000183">and while Celia and Rosalind were talking of Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000184">Frederick entered the room,</span> 
    <span id="f000185">and with looks full of anger ordered Rosalind instantly to leave the palace,</span> 
    <span id="f000186">and follow her father into banishment;</span> 
    <span id="f000187">telling Celia,</span> 
    <span id="f000188">who in vain pleaded for her,</span> 
    <span id="f000189">that he had only suffered Rosalind to stay upon her account.</span> 
    <span id="f000190">«I did not then,» said Celia,</span> 
    <span id="f000191">«entreat you to let her stay,</span> 
    <span id="f000192">for I was too young at that time to value her;</span> 
    <span id="f000193">but now that I know her worth,</span> 
    <span id="f000194">and that we so long have slept together,</span> 
    <span id="f000195">rose at the same instant,</span> 
    <span id="f000196">learned,</span> 
    <span id="f000197">played,</span> 
    <span id="f000198">and eat together,</span> 
    <span id="f000199">I cannot live out of her company.» Frederick replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000200">«She is too subtle for you;</span> 
    <span id="f000201">her smoothness,</span> 
    <span id="f000202">her very silence,</span> 
    <span id="f000203">and her patience speak to the people,</span> 
    <span id="f000204">and they pity her.</span> 
    <span id="f000205">You are a fool to plead for her,</span> 
    <span id="f000206">for you will seem more bright and virtuous when she is gone;</span> 
    <span id="f000207">therefore open not your lips in her favour,</span> 
    <span id="f000208">for the doom which I have passed upon her is irrevocable.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000209">When Celia found she could not prevail upon her father to let Rosalind remain with her,</span> 
    <span id="f000210">she generously resolved to accompany her;</span> 
    <span id="f000211">and leaving her father’s palace that night,</span> 
    <span id="f000212">she went along with her friend to seek Rosalind’s father,</span> 
    <span id="f000213">the banished duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000214">in the forest of Arden.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000215">Before they set out,</span> 
    <span id="f000216">Celia considered that it would be unsafe for two young ladies to travel in the rich clothes they then wore;</span> 
    <span id="f000217">she therefore proposed that they should disguise their rank by dressing themselves like country maids.</span> 
    <span id="f000218">Rosalind said it would be a still greater protection if one of them was to be dressed like a man:</span> 
    <span id="f000219">and so it was quickly agreed on between them,</span> 
    <span id="f000220">that as Rosalind was the tallest,</span> 
    <span id="f000221">she should wear the dress of a young countryman,</span> 
    <span id="f000222">and Celia should be habited like a country lass,</span> 
    <span id="f000223">and that they should say they were brother and sister,</span> 
    <span id="f000224">and Rosalind said she would be called Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000225">and Celia chose the name of Aliena.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000226">In this disguise,</span> 
    <span id="f000227">and taking their money and jewels to defray their expenses,</span> 
    <span id="f000228">these fair princesses set out on their long travel;</span> 
    <span id="f000229">for the forest of Arden was a long way off,</span> 
    <span id="f000230">beyond the boundaries of the duke’s dominions.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000231">The Lady Rosalind (or Ganymede as she must now be called) with her manly garb seemed to have put on a manly courage.</span> 
    <span id="f000232">The faithful friendship Celia had shown in accompanying Rosalind so many weary miles,</span> 
    <span id="f000233">made the new brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000234">in recompense for this true love,</span> 
    <span id="f000235">exert a cheerful spirit,</span> 
    <span id="f000236">as if he were indeed Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000237">the rustic and stout- hearted brother of the gentle village maiden,</span> 
    <span id="f000238">Aliena.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000239">When at last they came to the forest of Arden,</span> 
    <span id="f000240">they no longer found the convenient inns and good accommodations they had met with on the road;</span> 
    <span id="f000241">and being in want of food and rest,</span> 
    <span id="f000242">Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000243">who had so merrily cheered his sister with pleasant speeches and happy remarks all the way,</span> 
    <span id="f000244">now owned to Aliena that he was so weary,</span> 
    <span id="f000245">he could find in his heart to disgrace his man’s apparel,</span> 
    <span id="f000246">and cry like a woman;</span> 
    <span id="f000247">and Aliena declared she could go no farther;</span> 
    <span id="f000248">and then again Ganymede tried to recollect that it was a man’s duty to comfort and console a woman,</span> 
    <span id="f000249">as the weaker vessel;</span> 
    <span id="f000250">and to seem courageous to his new sister;</span> 
    <span id="f000251">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000252">«Come,</span> 
    <span id="f000253">have a good heart,</span> 
    <span id="f000254">my sister Aliena;</span> 
    <span id="f000255">we are now at the end of our travel,</span> 
    <span id="f000256">in the forest of Arden.» But feigned manliness and forced courage would no longer support them;</span> 
    <span id="f000257">for though they were in the forest of Arden,</span> 
    <span id="f000258">they knew not where to find the duke:</span> 
    <span id="f000259">and here the travel of these weary ladies might have come to a sad conclusion,</span> 
    <span id="f000260">for they might have lost themselves,</span> 
    <span id="f000261">and perished for want of food;</span> 
    <span id="f000262">but providentially,</span> 
    <span id="f000263">as they were sitting on the grass,</span> 
    <span id="f000264">almost dying with fatigue and hopeless of any relief,</span> 
    <span id="f000265">a countryman chanced to pass that way,</span> 
    <span id="f000266">and Ganymede once more tried to speak with a manly boldness,</span> 
    <span id="f000267">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000268">«Shepherd,</span> 
    <span id="f000269">if love or gold can in this desert place procure us entertainment,</span> 
    <span id="f000270">I pray you bring us where we may rest ourselves;</span> 
    <span id="f000271">for this young maid,</span> 
    <span id="f000272">my sister,</span> 
    <span id="f000273">is much fatigued with travelling,</span> 
    <span id="f000274">and faints for want of food.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000275">The man replied that he was only a servant to a shepherd,</span> 
    <span id="f000276">and that his master’s house was just going to be sold,</span> 
    <span id="f000277">and therefore they would find but poor entertainment;</span> 
    <span id="f000278">but that if they would go with him,</span> 
    <span id="f000279">they should be welcome to what there was.</span> 
    <span id="f000280">They followed the man,</span> 
    <span id="f000281">the near prospect of relief giving them fresh strength;</span> 
    <span id="f000282">and bought the house and sheep of the shepherd,</span> 
    <span id="f000283">and took the man who conducted them to the shepherd’s house to wait on them;</span> 
    <span id="f000284">and being by this means so fortunately provided with a neat cottage,</span> 
    <span id="f000285">and well supplied with provisions,</span> 
    <span id="f000286">they agreed to stay here till they could learn in what part of the forest the duke dwelt.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000287">When they were rested after the fatigue of their journey,</span> 
    <span id="f000288">they began to like their new way of life,</span> 
    <span id="f000289">and almost fancied themselves the shepherd and shepherdess they feigned to be:</span> 
    <span id="f000290">yet sometimes Ganymede remembered he had once been the same lady Rosalind who had so dearly loved the brave Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000291">because he was the son of old Sir Rowland,</span> 
    <span id="f000292">her father’s friend;</span> 
    <span id="f000293">and though Ganymede thought that Orlando was many miles distant,</span> 
    <span id="f000294">even so many weary miles as they had travelled,</span> 
    <span id="f000295">yet it soon appeared that Orlando was also in the forest of Arden:</span> 
    <span id="f000296">and in this manner this strange event came to pass.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000297">Orlando was the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,</span> 
    <span id="f000298">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000299">when he died,</span> 
    <span id="f000300">left him (Orlando being then very young) to the care of his eldest brother Oliver,</span> 
    <span id="f000301">charging Oliver on his blessing to give his brother a good education,</span> 
    <span id="f000302">and provide for him as became the dignity of their ancient house.</span> 
    <span id="f000303">Oliver proved an unworthy brother;</span> 
    <span id="f000304">and disregarding the commands of his dying father,</span> 
    <span id="f000305">he never put his bother to school,</span> 
    <span id="f000306">but kept him at home untaught and entirely neglected.</span> 
    <span id="f000307">But in his nature and in the noble qualities of his mind Orlando so much resembled his excellent father,</span> 
    <span id="f000308">that without any advantages of education he seemed like a youth who had been bred with the utmost care;</span> 
    <span id="f000309">and Oliver so envied the fine person and dignified manners of his untutored brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000310">that at last he wished to destroy him,</span> 
    <span id="f000311">and to effect this he set on people to persuade him to wrestle with the famous wrestler,</span> 
    <span id="f000312">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000313">as has been before related,</span> 
    <span id="f000314">had killed so many men.</span> 
    <span id="f000315">Now,</span> 
    <span id="f000316">it was this cruel brother’s neglect of him which made Orlando say he wished to die,</span> 
    <span id="f000317">being so friendless.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000318">When,</span> 
    <span id="f000319">contrary to the wicked hopes he had formed,</span> 
    <span id="f000320">his brother proved victorious,</span> 
    <span id="f000321">his envy and malice knew no bounds,</span> 
    <span id="f000322">and he swore he would burn the chamber where Orlando slept.</span> 
    <span id="f000323">He was overheard making this vow by one that had been an old and faithful servant to their father,</span> 
    <span id="f000324">and that loved Orlando because he resembled Sir Rowland.</span> 
    <span id="f000325">This old man went out to meet him when he returned from the duke’s palace,</span> 
    <span id="f000326">and when he saw Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000327">the peril his dear young master was in made him break out into these passionate exclamations:</span> 
    <span id="f000328">«O my gentle master,</span> 
    <span id="f000329">my sweet master,</span> 
    <span id="f000330">O you memory of old Sir Rowland!</span> 
    <span id="f000331">why are you virtuous?</span> 
    <span id="f000332">why are you gentle,</span> 
    <span id="f000333">strong,</span> 
    <span id="f000334">and valiant?</span> 
    <span id="f000335">and why would you be so fond to overcome the famous wrestler?</span> 
    <span id="f000336">Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.» Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000337">wondering what all this meant,</span> 
    <span id="f000338">asked him what was the matter.</span> 
    <span id="f000339">And then the old man told him how his wicked brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000340">envying the love all people bore him,</span> 
    <span id="f000341">and now hearing the fame he had gained by his victory in the duke s palace,</span> 
    <span id="f000342">intended to destroy him,</span> 
    <span id="f000343">by setting fire to his chamber that night;</span> 
    <span id="f000344">and in conclusion,</span> 
    <span id="f000345">advised him to escape the danger he was in by instant flight;</span> 
    <span id="f000346">and knowing Orlando had no money,</span> 
    <span id="f000347">Adam (for that was the good old man’s name) had brought out with him his own little hoard,</span> 
    <span id="f000348">and he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000349">«I have five hundred crowns,</span> 
    <span id="f000350">the thrifty hire I saved under your father,</span> 
    <span id="f000351">and laid by to be provision for me when my old limbs should become unfit for service;</span> 
    <span id="f000352">take that,</span> 
    <span id="f000353">and He that doth the ravens feed be comfort to my age!</span> 
    <span id="f000354">Here is the gold;</span> 
    <span id="f000355">all this I give to you:</span> 
    <span id="f000356">let me be your servant;</span> 
    <span id="f000357">though I look old I will do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities.» «O good old man!» said Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000358">«how well appears in you the constant service of the old world!</span> 
    <span id="f000359">You are not for the fashion of these times.</span> 
    <span id="f000360">We will go along together,</span> 
    <span id="f000361">and before your youthful wages are spent,</span> 
    <span id="f000362">I shall light upon some means for both our maintenance.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000363">Together then this faithful servant and his loved master set out;</span> 
    <span id="f000364">and Orlando and Adam travelled on,</span> 
    <span id="f000365">uncertain what course to pursue,</span> 
    <span id="f000366">till they came to the forest of Arden,</span> 
    <span id="f000367">and there they found themselves in the same distress for want of food that Ganymede and Aliena had been.</span> 
    <span id="f000368">They wandered on,</span> 
    <span id="f000369">seeking some human habitation,</span> 
    <span id="f000370">till they were almost spent with hunger and fatigue.</span> 
    <span id="f000371">Adam at last said:</span> 
    <span id="f000372">«O my dear master,</span> 
    <span id="f000373">I die for want of food,</span> 
    <span id="f000374">I can go no farther!» He then laid himself down,</span> 
    <span id="f000375">thinking to make that place his grave,</span> 
    <span id="f000376">and bade his dear master farewell.</span> 
    <span id="f000377">Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000378">seeing him in this weak state,</span> 
    <span id="f000379">took his old servant up in his arms,</span> 
    <span id="f000380">and carried him under the shelter of some pleasant trees;</span> 
    <span id="f000381">and he said to him:</span> 
    <span id="f000382">«Cheerly,</span> 
    <span id="f000383">old Adam,</span> 
    <span id="f000384">rest your weary limbs here awhile,</span> 
    <span id="f000385">and do not talk of dying!»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000386">Orlando then searched about to find some food,</span> 
    <span id="f000387">and he happened to arrive at that part of the forest where the duke was;</span> 
    <span id="f000388">and he and his friends were just going to eat their dinner,</span> 
    <span id="f000389">this royal duke being seated on the grass,</span> 
    <span id="f000390">under no other canopy than the shady covert of some large trees.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000391">Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000392">whom hunger had made desperate,</span> 
    <span id="f000393">drew his sword,</span> 
    <span id="f000394">intending to take their meat by force,</span> 
    <span id="f000395">and said:</span> 
    <span id="f000396">«Forbear and eat no more;</span> 
    <span id="f000397">I must have your food!» The duke asked him,</span> 
    <span id="f000398">if distress had made him so bold,</span> 
    <span id="f000399">or if he were a rude despiser of good manners?</span> 
    <span id="f000400">On this Orlando said,</span> 
    <span id="f000401">he was dying with hunger;</span> 
    <span id="f000402">and then the duke told him he was welcome to sit down and eat with them.</span> 
    <span id="f000403">Orlando hearing him speak so gently,</span> 
    <span id="f000404">put up his sword,</span> 
    <span id="f000405">and blushed with shame at the rude manner in which he had demanded their food.</span> 
    <span id="f000406">«Pardon me,</span> 
    <span id="f000407">I pray you,» said he:</span> 
    <span id="f000408">«I thought that all things had been savage here,</span> 
    <span id="f000409">and therefore I put on the countenance of stern command;</span> 
    <span id="f000410">but whatever men you are,</span> 
    <span id="f000411">that in this desert,</span> 
    <span id="f000412">under the shade of melancholy boughs,</span> 
    <span id="f000413">lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;</span> 
    <span id="f000414">if ever you have looked on better days;</span> 
    <span id="f000415">if ever you have been where bells have knolled to church;</span> 
    <span id="f000416">if you have ever sat at any good man’s feast;</span> 
    <span id="f000417">if ever from your eyelids you have wiped a tear,</span> 
    <span id="f000418">and know what it is to pity or be pitied,</span> 
    <span id="f000419">may gentle speeches now move you to do me human courtesy!» The duke replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000420">«True it is that we are men (as you say) who have seen better days,</span> 
    <span id="f000421">and though we have now our habitation in this wild forest,</span> 
    <span id="f000422">we have lived in towns and cities,</span> 
    <span id="f000423">and have with holy bell been knolled to church,</span> 
    <span id="f000424">have sat at good men’s feasts,</span> 
    <span id="f000425">and from our eyes have wiped the drops which sacred pity has engendered;</span> 
    <span id="f000426">therefore sit you down,</span> 
    <span id="f000427">and take of our refreshment as much as will minister to your wants.» «There is an old poor man,» answered Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000428">«who has limped after me many a weary step in pure love,</span> 
    <span id="f000429">oppressed at once with two sad infirmities,</span> 
    <span id="f000430">age and hunger;</span> 
    <span id="f000431">till he be satisfied,</span> 
    <span id="f000432">I must not touch a bit.» «Go,</span> 
    <span id="f000433">find him out,</span> 
    <span id="f000434">and bring him hither,» said the duke;</span> 
    <span id="f000435">«we will forbear to eat till you return.» Then Orlando went like a doe to kind its fawn and give it food;</span> 
    <span id="f000436">and presently returned,</span> 
    <span id="f000437">bringing Adam in his arms;</span> 
    <span id="f000438">and the duke said:</span> 
    <span id="f000439">«Set down your venerable burthen;</span> 
    <span id="f000440">you are both welcome»;</span> 
    <span id="f000441">and they fed the old man,</span> 
    <span id="f000442">and cheered his heart,</span> 
    <span id="f000443">and he revived,</span> 
    <span id="f000444">and recovered his health and strength again.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000445">The duke inquired who Orlando was;</span> 
    <span id="f000446">and when he found that he was the son of his old friend,</span> 
    <span id="f000447">Sir Rowland de Boys,</span> 
    <span id="f000448">he took him under his protection,</span> 
    <span id="f000449">and Orlando and his old servant lived with the duke in the forest.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000450">Orlando arrived in the forest not many days after Ganymede and Aliena came there,</span> 
    <span id="f000451">and (as has been before related) bought the shepherd’s cottage.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000452">Ganymede and Aliena were strangely surprised to find the name of Rosalind carved on the trees,</span> 
    <span id="f000453">and love-sonnets,</span> 
    <span id="f000454">fastened to them,</span> 
    <span id="f000455">all addressed to Rosalind;</span> 
    <span id="f000456">and while they were wondering how this could be,</span> 
    <span id="f000457">they met Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000458">and they perceived the chain which Rosalind had given him about his neck.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000459">Orlando little thought that Ganymede was the fair princess Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000460">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000461">by her noble condescension and favour,</span> 
    <span id="f000462">had so won his heart that he passed his whole time in carving her name upon the trees,</span> 
    <span id="f000463">and writing sonnets in praise of her beauty:</span> 
    <span id="f000464">but being much pleased with the graceful air of this pretty shepherd-youth,</span> 
    <span id="f000465">he entered into conversation with him,</span> 
    <span id="f000466">and he thought he saw a likeness in Ganymede to his beloved Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000467">but that he had none of the dignified deportment of that noble lady;</span> 
    <span id="f000468">for Ganymede assumed the forward manners often seen in youths when they are between boys and men,</span> 
    <span id="f000469">and with much archness and humour talked to Orlando of a certain lover,</span> 
    <span id="f000470">«who,» said he,</span> 
    <span id="f000471">«haunts our forest,</span> 
    <span id="f000472">and spoils our young trees with carving Rosalind upon their barks;</span> 
    <span id="f000473">and he hangs odes upon hawthorns,</span> 
    <span id="f000474">and elegies on brambles,</span> 
    <span id="f000475">all praising this same Rosalind.</span> 
    <span id="f000476">If I could find this lover,</span> 
    <span id="f000477">I would give him some good counsel that would soon cure him of his love.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000478">Orlando confessed that he was the fond lover of whom he spoke,</span> 
    <span id="f000479">and asked Ganymede to give him the good counsel he talked of.</span> 
    <span id="f000480">The remedy Ganymede proposed,</span> 
    <span id="f000481">and the counsel he gave him,</span> 
    <span id="f000482">was that Orlando should come every day to the cottage where he and his sister Aliena dwelt:</span> 
    <span id="f000483">«And then,» said Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000484">«I will feign myself to be Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000485">and you shall feign to court me in the same manner as you would do if I was Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000486">and then I will imitate the fantastic ways of whimsical ladies to their lovers,</span> 
    <span id="f000487">till I make you ashamed of your love;</span> 
    <span id="f000488">and this is the way I propose to cure you.» Orlando had no great faith in the remedy,</span> 
    <span id="f000489">yet he agreed to come every day to Ganymede’s cottage,</span> 
    <span id="f000490">and feign a playful courtship;</span> 
    <span id="f000491">and every day Orlando visited Ganymede and Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000492">and Orlando called the shepherd Ganymede his Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000493">and every day talked over all the fine words and flattering compliments which young men delight to use when they court their mistresses.</span> 
    <span id="f000494">It does not appear,</span> 
    <span id="f000495">however,</span> 
    <span id="f000496">that Ganymede made any progress in curing Orlando of his love for Rosalind.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000497">Though Orlando thought all this was but a sportive play (not dreaming that Ganymede was his very Rosalind),</span> 
    <span id="f000498">yet the opportunity it gave him of saying all the fond things he had in his heart,</span> 
    <span id="f000499">pleased his fancy almost as well as it did Ganymede’s,</span> 
    <span id="f000500">who enjoyed the secret jest in knowing these fine love-speeches were all addressed to the right person.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000501">In this manner many days passed pleasantly on with these young people;</span> 
    <span id="f000502">and the good-natured Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000503">seeing it made Ganymede happy,</span> 
    <span id="f000504">let him have his own way,</span> 
    <span id="f000505">and was diverted at the mock- courtship,</span> 
    <span id="f000506">and did not care to remind Ganymede that the Lady Rosalind had not yet made herself known to the duke her father,</span> 
    <span id="f000507">whose place of resort in the forest they had learnt from Orlando.</span> 
    <span id="f000508">Ganymede met the duke one day,</span> 
    <span id="f000509">and had some talk with him,</span> 
    <span id="f000510">and the duke asked of what parentage he came.</span> 
    <span id="f000511">Ganymede answered that he came of as good parentage as he did,</span> 
    <span id="f000512">which made the duke smile,</span> 
    <span id="f000513">for he did not suspect the pretty shepherd-boy came of royal lineage.</span> 
    <span id="f000514">Then seeing the duke look well and happy,</span> 
    <span id="f000515">Ganymede was content to put off all further explanation for a few days longer.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000516">One morning,</span> 
    <span id="f000517">as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000518">he saw a man lying asleep on the ground,</span> 
    <span id="f000519">and a large green snake had twisted itself about his neck.</span> 
    <span id="f000520">The snake,</span> 
    <span id="f000521">seeing Orlando approach,</span> 
    <span id="f000522">glided away among the bushes.</span> 
    <span id="f000523">Orlando went nearer,</span> 
    <span id="f000524">and then he discovered a lioness lie crouching,</span> 
    <span id="f000525">with her head on the ground,</span> 
    <span id="f000526">with a cat-like watch,</span> 
    <span id="f000527">waiting until the sleeping man awaked (for it is said that lions will prey on nothing that is dead or sleeping).</span> 
    <span id="f000528">It seemed as if Orlando was sent by Providence to free the man from the danger of the snake and lioness;</span> 
    <span id="f000529">but when Orlando looked in the man’s face,</span> 
    <span id="f000530">he perceived that the sleeper who was exposed to this double peril,</span> 
    <span id="f000531">was his own brother Oliver,</span> 
    <span id="f000532">who had so cruelly used him,</span> 
    <span id="f000533">and had threatened to destroy him by fire;</span> 
    <span id="f000534">and he was almost tempted to leave him a prey to the hungry lioness;</span> 
    <span id="f000535">but brotherly affection and the gentleness of his nature soon overcame his first anger against his brother;</span> 
    <span id="f000536">and he drew his sword,</span> 
    <span id="f000537">and attacked the lioness,</span> 
    <span id="f000538">and slew her,</span> 
    <span id="f000539">and thus preserved his brother’s life both from the venomous snake and from the furious lioness;</span> 
    <span id="f000540">but before Orlando could conquer the lioness,</span> 
    <span id="f000541">she had torn one of his arms with her sharp claws.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000542">While Orlando was engaged with the lioness,</span> 
    <span id="f000543">Oliver awaked,</span> 
    <span id="f000544">and perceiving that his brother Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000545">whom he had so cruelly treated,</span> 
    <span id="f000546">was saving him from the fury of a wild beast at the risk of his own life,</span> 
    <span id="f000547">shame and remorse at once seized him,</span> 
    <span id="f000548">and he repented of his unworthy conduct,</span> 
    <span id="f000549">and besought with many tears his brother’s pardon for the injuries he had done him.</span> 
    <span id="f000550">Orlando rejoiced to see him so penitent,</span> 
    <span id="f000551">and readily forgave him:</span> 
    <span id="f000552">they embraced each other;</span> 
    <span id="f000553">and from that hour Oliver loved Orlando with a true brotherly affection,</span> 
    <span id="f000554">though he had come to the forest bent on his destruction.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000555">The wound in Orlando’s arm having bled very much,</span> 
    <span id="f000556">he found himself too weak to go to visit Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000557">and therefore he desired his brother to go and tell Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000558">«whom,» said Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000559">«I in sport do call my Rosalind,» the accident which had befallen him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000560">Thither then Oliver went,</span> 
    <span id="f000561">and told to Ganymede and Aliena how Orlando had saved his life:</span> 
    <span id="f000562">and when he had finished the story of Orlando’s bravery,</span> 
    <span id="f000563">and his own providential escape,</span> 
    <span id="f000564">he owned to them that he was Orlando’s brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000565">who had so cruelly used him;</span> 
    <span id="f000566">and then he told them of their reconciliation.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000567">The sincere sorrow that Oliver expressed for his offences made such a lively impression on the kind heart of Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000568">that she instantly fell in love with him;</span> 
    <span id="f000569">and Oliver observing how much she pitied the distress he told her he felt for his fault,</span> 
    <span id="f000570">he as suddenly fell in love with her.</span> 
    <span id="f000571">But while love was thus stealing into the hearts of Aliena and Oliver,</span> 
    <span id="f000572">he was no less busy with Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000573">who hearing of the danger Orlando had been in,</span> 
    <span id="f000574">and that he was wounded by the lioness,</span> 
    <span id="f000575">fainted;</span> 
    <span id="f000576">and when he recovered,</span> 
    <span id="f000577">he pretended that he had counterfeited the swoon in the imaginary character of Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000578">and Ganymede said to Oliver:</span> 
    <span id="f000579">«Tell your brother Orlando how well I counterfeited a swoon.» But Oliver saw by the paleness of his complexion that he did really faint,</span> 
    <span id="f000580">and much wondering at the weakness of the young man,</span> 
    <span id="f000581">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000582">«Well,</span> 
    <span id="f000583">if you did counterfeit,</span> 
    <span id="f000584">take a good heart,</span> 
    <span id="f000585">and counterfeit to be a man.» «So I do,» replied Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000586">truly,</span> 
    <span id="f000587">«but I should have been a woman by right.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000588">Oliver made this visit a very long one,</span> 
    <span id="f000589">and when at last he returned back to his brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000590">he had much news to tell him;</span> 
    <span id="f000591">for besides the account of Ganymede’s fainting at the hearing that Orlando was wounded,</span> 
    <span id="f000592">Oliver told him how he had fallen in love with the fair shepherdess Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000593">and that she had lent a favourable ear to his suit.</span> 
    <span id="f000594">even in this their first interview:</span> 
    <span id="f000595">and he talked to his brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000596">as of a thing almost settled,</span> 
    <span id="f000597">that he should marry Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000598">saying,</span> 
    <span id="f000599">that he so well loved her,</span> 
    <span id="f000600">that he would live here as a shepherd,</span> 
    <span id="f000601">and settle his estate and house at home upon Orlando.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000602">«You have my consent,» said Orlando.</span> 
    <span id="f000603">«Let your wedding be to-morrow,</span> 
    <span id="f000604">and I will invite the duke and his friends.</span> 
    <span id="f000605">Go and persuade your shepherdess to this:</span> 
    <span id="f000606">she is now alone,</span> 
    <span id="f000607">for look,</span> 
    <span id="f000608">here comes her brother.» Oliver went to Aliena;</span> 
    <span id="f000609">and Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000610">whom Orlando had perceived approaching,</span> 
    <span id="f000611">came to inquire after the health of his wounded friend.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000612">When Orlando and Ganymede began to talk over the sudden love which had taken place between Oliver and Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000613">Orlando said he had advised his brother to persuade his fair shepherdess to be married on the morrow,</span> 
    <span id="f000614">and then he added how much he could wish to be married on the same day to his Rosalind.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000615">Ganymede,</span> 
    <span id="f000616">who well approved of this arrangement,</span> 
    <span id="f000617">said that if Orlando really loved Rosalind as well as he professed to do,</span> 
    <span id="f000618">he should have his wish;</span> 
    <span id="f000619">for on the morrow he would engage to make Rosalind appear in her own person,</span> 
    <span id="f000620">and also that Rosalind should be willing to marry Orlando.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000621">This seemingly wonderful event,</span> 
    <span id="f000622">which,</span> 
    <span id="f000623">as Ganymede was the lady Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000624">he could so easily perform,</span> 
    <span id="f000625">he pretended he would bring to pass by the aid of magic,</span> 
    <span id="f000626">which he said he had learnt of an uncle who was a famous magician.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000627">The fond lover Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000628">half believing and half doubting what he heard,</span> 
    <span id="f000629">asked Ganymede if he spoke in sober meaning.</span> 
    <span id="f000630">«By my life I do,» said Ganymede;</span> 
    <span id="f000631">«therefore put on your best clothes,</span> 
    <span id="f000632">and bid the duke and your friends to your wedding;</span> 
    <span id="f000633">for if you desire to be married to-morrow to Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000634">she shall be here.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000635">The next morning,</span> 
    <span id="f000636">Oliver having obtained the consent of Aliena,</span> 
    <span id="f000637">they came into the presence of the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000638">and with them also came Orlando.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000639">They being all assembled to celebrate this double marriage,</span> 
    <span id="f000640">and as yet only one of the brides appearing,</span> 
    <span id="f000641">there was much of wondering and conjecture,</span> 
    <span id="f000642">but they mostly thought that Ganymede was making a jest of Orlando.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000643">The duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000644">hearing that it was his own daughter that was to be brought in this strange way,</span> 
    <span id="f000645">asked Orlando if he believed the shepherd-boy could really do what he had promised;</span> 
    <span id="f000646">and while Orlando was answering that he knew not what to think,</span> 
    <span id="f000647">Ganymede entered,</span> 
    <span id="f000648">and asked the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000649">if he brought his daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000650">whether he would consent to her marriage with Orlando.</span> 
    <span id="f000651">«That I would,» said the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000652">«if I had kingdoms to give with her.» Ganymede then said to Orlando:</span> 
    <span id="f000653">«And you say you will marry her if I bring her here.» «That I would,» said Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000654">«if I were king of many kingdoms.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000655">Ganymede and Aliena then went out together,</span> 
    <span id="f000656">and Ganymede throwing off his male attire,</span> 
    <span id="f000657">and being once more dressed in woman’s apparel,</span> 
    <span id="f000658">quickly became Rosalind without the power of magic;</span> 
    <span id="f000659">and Aliena changing her country garb for her own rich clothes,</span> 
    <span id="f000660">was with as little trouble transformed into the lady Celia.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000661">While they were gone,</span> 
    <span id="f000662">the duke said to Orlando,</span> 
    <span id="f000663">that he thought the shepherd Ganymede very like his daughter Rosalind;</span> 
    <span id="f000664">and Orlando said,</span> 
    <span id="f000665">he also had observed the resemblance.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000666">They had no time to wonder how all this would end,</span> 
    <span id="f000667">for Rosalind and Celia in their own clothes entered;</span> 
    <span id="f000668">and no longer pretending that it was by the power of magic that she came there,</span> 
    <span id="f000669">Rosalind threw herself on her knees before her father,</span> 
    <span id="f000670">and begged his blessing.</span> 
    <span id="f000671">It seemed so wonderful to all present that she should so suddenly appear,</span> 
    <span id="f000672">that it might well have passed for magic;</span> 
    <span id="f000673">but Rosalind would no longer trifle with her father,</span> 
    <span id="f000674">and told him the story of her banishment,</span> 
    <span id="f000675">and of her dwelling in the forest as a shepherd-boy,</span> 
    <span id="f000676">her cousin Celia passing as her sister.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000677">The duke ratified the consent he had already given to the marriage;</span> 
    <span id="f000678">and Orlando and Rosalind,</span> 
    <span id="f000679">Oliver and Celia,</span> 
    <span id="f000680">were married at the same time.</span> 
    <span id="f000681">And though their wedding could not be celebrated in this wild forest with any of the parade or splendour usual on such occasions,</span> 
    <span id="f000682">yet a happier wedding-day was never passed:</span> 
    <span id="f000683">and while they were eating their venison under the cool shade of the pleasant trees,</span> 
    <span id="f000684">as if nothing should be wanting to complete the felicity of this good duke and the true lovers,</span> 
    <span id="f000685">an unexpected messenger arrived to tell the duke the joyful news,</span> 
    <span id="f000686">that his dukedom was restored to him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000687">The usurper,</span> 
    <span id="f000688">enraged at the flight of his daughter Celia,</span> 
    <span id="f000689">and hearing that every day men of great worth resorted to the forest of Arden to join the lawful duke in his exile,</span> 
    <span id="f000690">much envying that his brother should be so highly respected in his adversity,</span> 
    <span id="f000691">put himself at the head of a large force,</span> 
    <span id="f000692">and advanced towards the forest,</span> 
    <span id="f000693">intending to seize his brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000694">and put him with all his faithful followers to the sword;</span> 
    <span id="f000695">but,</span> 
    <span id="f000696">by a wonderful interposition of Providence,</span> 
    <span id="f000697">this bad brother was converted from his evil intention;</span> 
    <span id="f000698">for just as he entered the skirts of the wild forest,</span> 
    <span id="f000699">he was met by an old religious man,</span> 
    <span id="f000700">a hermit,</span> 
    <span id="f000701">with whom he had much talk,</span> 
    <span id="f000702">and who in the end completely turned his heart from his wicked design.</span> 
    <span id="f000703">Thenceforward he became a true penitent,</span> 
    <span id="f000704">and resolved,</span> 
    <span id="f000705">relinquishing his unjust dominion,</span> 
    <span id="f000706">to spend the remainder of his days in a religious house.</span> 
    <span id="f000707">The first act of his newly-conceived penitence was to send a messenger to his brother (as has been related) to offer to restore to him his dukedom,</span> 
    <span id="f000708">which he had usurped so long,</span> 
    <span id="f000709">and with it the lands and revenues of his friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000710">the faithful followers of his adversity.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000711">This joyful news,</span> 
    <span id="f000712">as unexpected as it was welcome,</span> 
    <span id="f000713">came opportunely to heighten the festivity and rejoicings at the wedding of the princesses.</span> 
    <span id="f000714">Celia complimented her cousin on this good fortune which had happened to the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000715">Rosalind’s father,</span> 
    <span id="f000716">and wished her joy very sincerely,</span> 
    <span id="f000717">though she herself was no longer heir to the dukedom,</span> 
    <span id="f000718">but by this restoration which her father had made,</span> 
    <span id="f000719">Rosalind was now the heir:</span> 
    <span id="f000720">so completely was the love of these two cousins unmixed with anything of jealousy or of envy.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000721">The duke had now an opportunity of rewarding those true friends who had stayed with him in his banishment;</span> 
    <span id="f000722">and these worthy followers,</span> 
    <span id="f000723">though they had patiently shared his adverse fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000724">were very well pleased to return in peace and prosperity to the palace of their lawful duke.</span></p>
