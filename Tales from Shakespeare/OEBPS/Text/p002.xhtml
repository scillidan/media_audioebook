   <h1 class="chapterTitle"><span id="f000001">Preface</span></h1> 
   <p><span id="f000002">The following Tales are meant to be submitted to the young reader as an introduction to the study of Shakespeare,</span> 
    <span id="f000003">for which purpose his words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in;</span> 
    <span id="f000004">and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story,</span> 
    <span id="f000005">diligent are has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote:</span> 
    <span id="f000006">therefore,</span> 
    <span id="f000007">words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000008">In those tales which have been taken from the Tragedies,</span> 
    <span id="f000009">the young readers will perceive,</span> 
    <span id="f000010">when they come to see the source from which these stories are derived,</span> 
    <span id="f000011">that Shakespeare’s own words,</span> 
    <span id="f000012">with little alteration,</span> 
    <span id="f000013">recur very frequently in the narrative as well as in the dialogue;</span> 
    <span id="f000014">but in those made from the Comedies the writers found themselves scarcely ever able to turn his words into the narrative form:</span> 
    <span id="f000015">therefore it is feared that,</span> 
    <span id="f000016">in them,</span> 
    <span id="f000017">dialogue has been made use of too frequently for young people not accustomed to the dramatic form of writing.</span> 
    <span id="f000018">But this fault,</span> 
    <span id="f000019">if it be a fault,</span> 
    <span id="f000020">has been caused by an earnest wish to give as much of Shakespeare’s own words as possible:</span> 
    <span id="f000021">and if the «He said,» and «She said,» the question and the reply,</span> 
    <span id="f000022">should sometimes seem tedious to their young ears,</span> 
    <span id="f000023">they must pardon it,</span> 
    <span id="f000024">because it was the only way in which could be given to them a few hints and little foretastes of the great pleasure which awaits them in their elder years,</span> 
    <span id="f000025">when they come to the rich treasures from which these small and valueless coins are extracted;</span> 
    <span id="f000026">pretending to no other merit than as faint and imperfect stamps of Shakespeare’s matchless image.</span> 
    <span id="f000027">Faint and imperfect images they must be called,</span> 
    <span id="f000028">because the beauty of his language is too frequently destroyed by the necessity of changing many of his excellent words into words far less expressive of his true sense,</span> 
    <span id="f000029">to make it read something like prose;</span> 
    <span id="f000030">and even in some few places,</span> 
    <span id="f000031">where his blank verse is given unaltered,</span> 
    <span id="f000032">as hoping from its simple plainness to cheat the young reader into the belief that they are reading prose,</span> 
    <span id="f000033">yet still his language being transplanted from its own natural soil and wild poetic garden,</span> 
    <span id="f000034">it must want much of its native beauty.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000035">It has been wished to make these Tales easy reading for very young children.</span> 
    <span id="f000036">To the utmost of their ability the writers have constantly kept this in mind;</span> 
    <span id="f000037">but the subjects of most of them made this a very difficult task.</span> 
    <span id="f000038">It was no easy matter to give the histories of men and women in terms familiar to the apprehension of a very young mind.</span> 
    <span id="f000039">For young ladies too,</span> 
    <span id="f000040">it has been the intention chiefly to write;</span> 
    <span id="f000041">because boys being generally permitted the use of their fathers’ libraries at a much earlier age than girls are,</span> 
    <span id="f000042">they frequently have the best scenes of Shakespeare by heart,</span> 
    <span id="f000043">before their sisters are permitted to look into this manly book;</span> 
    <span id="f000044">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000045">therefore,</span> 
    <span id="f000046">instead of recommending these Tales to the perusal of young gentlemen who can read them so much better in the originals,</span> 
    <span id="f000047">their kind assistance is rather requested in explaining to their sisters such parts as are hardest for them to understand:</span> 
    <span id="f000048">and when they have helped them to get over the difficulties,</span> 
    <span id="f000049">then perhaps they will read to them (carefully selecting what is proper for a young sister’s ear) some passage which has pleased them in one of these stories,</span> 
    <span id="f000050">in the very words of the scene from which it is taken;</span> 
    <span id="f000051">and it is hoped they will find that the beautiful extracts,</span> 
    <span id="f000052">the select passages,</span> 
    <span id="f000053">they may choose to give their sisters in this way will be much better relished and understood from their having some notion of the general story from one of these imperfect abridgments;</span> 
    <span id="f000054">which if they be fortunately so done as to prove delightful to any of the young readers,</span> 
    <span id="f000055">it is hoped that no worse effect will result than to make them wish themselves a little older,</span> 
    <span id="f000056">that they may be allowed to read the Plays at full length (such a wish will be neither peevish nor irrational).</span> 
    <span id="f000057">When time and leave of judicious friends shall put them into their hands,</span> 
    <span id="f000058">they will discover in such of them as are here abridged (not to mention almost as many more,</span> 
    <span id="f000059">which are left untouched) many surprising events and turns of fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000060">which for their infinite variety could not be contained in this little book,</span> 
    <span id="f000061">besides a world of sprightly and cheerful characters,</span> 
    <span id="f000062">both men and women,</span> 
    <span id="f000063">the humour of which it was feared would be lost if it were attempted to reduce the length of them.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000064">What these Tales shall have been to the young readers,</span> 
    <span id="f000065">that and much more it is the writers’ wish that the true Plays of Shakespeare may prove to them in older years  –</span> 
    <span id="f000066">enrichers of the fancy,</span> 
    <span id="f000067">strengtheners of virtue,</span> 
    <span id="f000068">a withdrawing from all selfish and mercenary thoughts,</span> 
    <span id="f000069">a lesson of all sweet and honourable thoughts and actions,</span> 
    <span id="f000070">to teach courtesy,</span> 
    <span id="f000071">benignity,</span> 
    <span id="f000072">generosity,</span> 
    <span id="f000073">humanity:</span> 
    <span id="f000074">for of examples,</span> 
    <span id="f000075">teaching these virtues,</span> 
    <span id="f000076">his pages are full.</span></p>
