   <h1 class="chapterTitle"><span id="f000001">Timon of Athens</span></h1> 
   <p><span id="f000002">Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000003">a lord of Athens,</span> 
    <span id="f000004">in the enjoyment of a princely fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000005">affected a humour of liberality which knew no limits.</span> 
    <span id="f000006">His almost infinite wealth could not flow in so fast,</span> 
    <span id="f000007">but he poured it out faster upon all sorts and degrees of people.</span> 
    <span id="f000008">Not the poor only tasted of his bounty,</span> 
    <span id="f000009">but great lords did not disdain to rank themselves among his dependents and followers.</span> 
    <span id="f000010">His table was resorted to by all the luxurious feasters,</span> 
    <span id="f000011">and his house was open to all comers and goers at Athens.</span> 
    <span id="f000012">His large wealth combined with his free and prodigal nature to subdue all hearts to his love;</span> 
    <span id="f000013">men of all minds and dispositions tendered their services to lord Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000014">from the glass-faced flatterer,</span> 
    <span id="f000015">whose face reflects as in a mirror the present humour of his patron,</span> 
    <span id="f000016">to the rough and unbending cynic,</span> 
    <span id="f000017">who affecting a contempt of men’s persons,</span> 
    <span id="f000018">and an indifference to worldly things,</span> 
    <span id="f000019">yet could not stand out against the gracious manners and munificent soul of lord Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000020">but would come (against his nature) to partake of his royal entertainments,</span> 
    <span id="f000021">and return most rich in his own estimation if he had received a nod or a salutation from Timon.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000022">If a poet had composed a work which wanted a recommendatory introduction to the world,</span> 
    <span id="f000023">he had no more to do but to dedicate it to lord Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000024">and the poem was sure of sale,</span> 
    <span id="f000025">besides a present purse from the patron,</span> 
    <span id="f000026">and daily access to his house and table.</span> 
    <span id="f000027">If a painter had a picture to dispose of,</span> 
    <span id="f000028">he had only to take it to lord Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000029">and pretend to consult his taste as to the merits of it;</span> 
    <span id="f000030">nothing more was wanting to persuade the liberal-hearted lord to buy it.</span> 
    <span id="f000031">If a jeweller had a stone of price,</span> 
    <span id="f000032">or a mercer rich costly stuffs,</span> 
    <span id="f000033">which for their costliness lay upon his hands,</span> 
    <span id="f000034">lord Timon’s house was a ready mart always open,</span> 
    <span id="f000035">where they might get off their wares or their jewellery at any price,</span> 
    <span id="f000036">and the good-natured lord would thank them into the bargain,</span> 
    <span id="f000037">as if they had done him a piece of courtesy in letting him have the refusal of such precious commodities.</span> 
    <span id="f000038">So that by this means his house was thronged with superfluous purchases,</span> 
    <span id="f000039">of no use but to swell uneasy and ostentatious pomp;</span> 
    <span id="f000040">and his person was still more inconveniently beset with a crowd of these idle visitors,</span> 
    <span id="f000041">lying poets,</span> 
    <span id="f000042">painters,</span> 
    <span id="f000043">sharking tradesmen,</span> 
    <span id="f000044">lords,</span> 
    <span id="f000045">ladies,</span> 
    <span id="f000046">needy courtiers,</span> 
    <span id="f000047">and expectants,</span> 
    <span id="f000048">who continually filled his lobbies,</span> 
    <span id="f000049">raining their fulsome flatteries in whispers in his ears,</span> 
    <span id="f000050">sacrificing to him with adulation as to a God,</span> 
    <span id="f000051">making sacred the very stirrup by which he mounted his horse,</span> 
    <span id="f000052">and seeming as though they drank the free air but through his permission and bounty.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000053">Some of these daily dependents were young men of birth,</span> 
    <span id="f000054">who (their means not answering to their extravagance) had been put in prison by creditors,</span> 
    <span id="f000055">and redeemed thence by lord Timon;</span> 
    <span id="f000056">these young prodigals thenceforward fastened upon his lordship,</span> 
    <span id="f000057">as if by common sympathy he were necessarily endeared to all such spendthrifts and loose livers,</span> 
    <span id="f000058">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000059">not being able to follow him in his wealth,</span> 
    <span id="f000060">found it easier to copy him in prodigality and copious spending of what was their own.</span> 
    <span id="f000061">One of these flesh-flies was Ventidius,</span> 
    <span id="f000062">for whose debts,</span> 
    <span id="f000063">unjustly contracted,</span> 
    <span id="f000064">Timon but lately had paid down the sum of five talents.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000065">But among this confluence,</span> 
    <span id="f000066">this great flood of visitors,</span> 
    <span id="f000067">none were more conspicuous than the makers of presents and givers of gifts.</span> 
    <span id="f000068">It was fortunate for these men if Timon took a fancy to a dog or a horse,</span> 
    <span id="f000069">or any piece of cheap furniture which was theirs.</span> 
    <span id="f000070">The thing so praised,</span> 
    <span id="f000071">whatever it was,</span> 
    <span id="f000072">was sure to be sent the next morning with the compliments of the giver for lord Timon’s acceptance,</span> 
    <span id="f000073">and apologies for the unworthiness of the gift;</span> 
    <span id="f000074">and this dog or horse,</span> 
    <span id="f000075">or whatever it might be,</span> 
    <span id="f000076">did not fail to produce from Timon’s bounty,</span> 
    <span id="f000077">who would not be outdone in gifts,</span> 
    <span id="f000078">perhaps twenty dogs or horses,</span> 
    <span id="f000079">certainly presents of far richer worth,</span> 
    <span id="f000080">as these pretended donors knew well enough,</span> 
    <span id="f000081">and that their false presents were but the putting out of so much money at large and speedy interest.</span> 
    <span id="f000082">In this way lord Lucius had lately sent to Timon a present of four milk-white horses,</span> 
    <span id="f000083">trapped in silver,</span> 
    <span id="f000084">which this cunning lord had observed Timon upon some occasion to commend;</span> 
    <span id="f000085">and another lord,</span> 
    <span id="f000086">Lucullus,</span> 
    <span id="f000087">had bestowed upon him in the same pretended way of free gift a brace of greyhounds,</span> 
    <span id="f000088">whose make and fleetness Timon had been heard to admire;</span> 
    <span id="f000089">these presents the easy-hearted lord accepted without suspicion of the dishonest views of the presenters;</span> 
    <span id="f000090">and the givers of course were rewarded with some rich return,</span> 
    <span id="f000091">a diamond or some jewel of twenty times the value of their false and mercenary donation.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000092">Sometimes these creatures would go to work in a more direct way,</span> 
    <span id="f000093">and with gross and palpable artifice,</span> 
    <span id="f000094">which yet the credulous Timon was too blind to see,</span> 
    <span id="f000095">would affect to admire and praise something that Timon possessed,</span> 
    <span id="f000096">a bargain that he had bought,</span> 
    <span id="f000097">or some late purchase,</span> 
    <span id="f000098">which was sure to draw from this yielding and soft-hearted lord a gift of the thing commended,</span> 
    <span id="f000099">for no service in the world done for it but the easy expense of a little cheap and obvious flattery.</span> 
    <span id="f000100">In this way Timon but the other day had given to one of these mean lords the bay courser which he himself rode upon,</span> 
    <span id="f000101">because his lordship had been pleased to say that it was a handsome beast and went well;</span> 
    <span id="f000102">and Timon knew that no man ever justly praised what he did not wish to possess.</span> 
    <span id="f000103">For lord Timon weighed his friends" affection with his own,</span> 
    <span id="f000104">and so fond was he of bestowing,</span> 
    <span id="f000105">that he could have dealt kingdoms to these supposed friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000106">and never have been weary.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000107">Not that Timon’s wealth all went to enrich these wicked flatterers;</span> 
    <span id="f000108">he could do noble and praiseworthy actions;</span> 
    <span id="f000109">and when a servant of his once loved the daughter of a rich Athenian,</span> 
    <span id="f000110">but could not hope to obtain her by reason that in wealth and rank the maid was so far above him,</span> 
    <span id="f000111">lord Timon freely bestowed upon his servant three Athenian talents,</span> 
    <span id="f000112">to make his fortune equal with the dowry which the father of the young maid demanded of him who should be her husband.</span> 
    <span id="f000113">But for the most part,</span> 
    <span id="f000114">knaves and parasites had the command of his fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000115">false friends whom he did not know to be such,</span> 
    <span id="f000116">but,</span> 
    <span id="f000117">because they flocked around his person,</span> 
    <span id="f000118">he thought they must needs love him;</span> 
    <span id="f000119">and because they smiled and flattered him,</span> 
    <span id="f000120">he thought surely that his conduct was approved by all the wise and good.</span> 
    <span id="f000121">And when he was feasting in the midst of all these flatterers and mock friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000122">when they were eating him up,</span> 
    <span id="f000123">and draining his fortunes dry with large draughts of richest wines drunk to his health and prosperity,</span> 
    <span id="f000124">he could not perceive the difference of a friend from a flatterer,</span> 
    <span id="f000125">but to his deluded eyes (made proud with the sight) it seemed a precious comfort to have so many like brothers commanding one another’s fortunes (though it was his own fortune which paid all the costs),</span> 
    <span id="f000126">and with joy they would run over at the spectacle of such,</span> 
    <span id="f000127">as it appeared to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000128">truly festive and fraternal meeting.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000129">But while he thus outwent the very heart of kindness,</span> 
    <span id="f000130">and poured out his bounty,</span> 
    <span id="f000131">as if Plutus,</span> 
    <span id="f000132">the god of gold,</span> 
    <span id="f000133">had been but his steward;</span> 
    <span id="f000134">while thus he proceeded without care or stop,</span> 
    <span id="f000135">so senseless of expense that he would neither inquire how he could maintain it,</span> 
    <span id="f000136">nor cease his wild flow of riot;</span> 
    <span id="f000137">his riches,</span> 
    <span id="f000138">which were not infinite,</span> 
    <span id="f000139">must needs melt away before a prodigality which knew no limits.</span> 
    <span id="f000140">But who should tell him so?</span> 
    <span id="f000141">his flatterers?</span> 
    <span id="f000142">they had no interest in shutting his eyes.</span> 
    <span id="f000143">In vain did his honest steward Flavius try to represent to him his condition,</span> 
    <span id="f000144">laying his accounts before him,</span> 
    <span id="f000145">begging of him,</span> 
    <span id="f000146">praying of him,</span> 
    <span id="f000147">with an importunity that on any other occasion would have been unmannerly in a servant,</span> 
    <span id="f000148">beseeching him with tears to look into the state of his affairs.</span> 
    <span id="f000149">Timon would still put him off,</span> 
    <span id="f000150">and turn the discourse to something else;</span> 
    <span id="f000151">for nothing is so deaf to remonstrance as riches turned to poverty,</span> 
    <span id="f000152">nothing is so unwilling to believe its situation,</span> 
    <span id="f000153">nothing so incredulous to its own true state,</span> 
    <span id="f000154">and hard to give credit to a reverse.</span> 
    <span id="f000155">Often had this good steward,</span> 
    <span id="f000156">this honest creature,</span> 
    <span id="f000157">when all the rooms of Timon’s great house have been choked up with riotous feeders at his master’s cost,</span> 
    <span id="f000158">when the floors have wept with drunken spilling of wine,</span> 
    <span id="f000159">and every apartment has blazed with lights and resounded with music and feasting,</span> 
    <span id="f000160">often had he retired by himself to some solitary spot,</span> 
    <span id="f000161">and wept faster than the wine ran from the wasteful casks within,</span> 
    <span id="f000162">to see the mad bounty of his lord,</span> 
    <span id="f000163">and to think,</span> 
    <span id="f000164">when the means were gone which brought him praises from all sorts of people,</span> 
    <span id="f000165">how quickly the breath would be gone of which the praise was made;</span> 
    <span id="f000166">praises won in feasting would be lost in feasting,</span> 
    <span id="f000167">and at one cloud of winter-showers these flies would disappear.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000168">But now the time was come that Timon could shut his ears no longer to the representations of this faithful steward.</span> 
    <span id="f000169">Money must be had;</span> 
    <span id="f000170">and when he ordered Flavius to sell some of his land for that purpose,</span> 
    <span id="f000171">Flavius informed him,</span> 
    <span id="f000172">what he had in vain endeavoured at several times before to make him listen to,</span> 
    <span id="f000173">that most of his land was already sold or forfeited,</span> 
    <span id="f000174">and that all he possessed at present was not enough to pay the one half of what he owed.</span> 
    <span id="f000175">Struck with wonder at this presentation,</span> 
    <span id="f000176">Timon hastily replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000177">«My lands extend from Athens to Lacedaemon.» «O my good lord,» said Flavius,</span> 
    <span id="f000178">«the world is but a world,</span> 
    <span id="f000179">and has bounds;</span> 
    <span id="f000180">were it all yours to give in a breath,</span> 
    <span id="f000181">how quickly were it gone!»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000182">Timon consoled himself that no villanous bounty had yet come from him,</span> 
    <span id="f000183">that if he had given his wealth away unwisely,</span> 
    <span id="f000184">it had not been bestowed to feed his vices,</span> 
    <span id="f000185">but to cherish his friends;</span> 
    <span id="f000186">and he made the kind-hearted steward (who was weeping) to take comfort in the assurance that his master could never lack means,</span> 
    <span id="f000187">while he had so many noble friends;</span> 
    <span id="f000188">and this infatuated lord persuaded himself that he had nothing to do but to send and borrow,</span> 
    <span id="f000189">to use every man’s fortune (that had ever tasted his bounty) in this extremity,</span> 
    <span id="f000190">as freely as his own.</span> 
    <span id="f000191">Then with a cheerful look,</span> 
    <span id="f000192">as if confident of the trial,</span> 
    <span id="f000193">he severally despatched messengers to lord Lucius,</span> 
    <span id="f000194">to lords Lucullus and Sempronius,</span> 
    <span id="f000195">men upon whom he had lavished his gifts in past times without measure or moderation;</span> 
    <span id="f000196">and to Ventidius,</span> 
    <span id="f000197">whom he had lately released out of prison by paying his debts,</span> 
    <span id="f000198">and who,</span> 
    <span id="f000199">by the death of his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000200">was now come into the possession of an ample fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000201">and well enabled to requite Timon’s courtesy:</span> 
    <span id="f000202">to request of Ventidius the return of those five talents which he had paid for him,</span> 
    <span id="f000203">and of each of those noble lords the loan of fifty talents;</span> 
    <span id="f000204">nothing doubting that their gratitude would supply his wants (if he needed it) to the amount of five hundred times fifty talents.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000205">Lucullus was the first applied to.</span> 
    <span id="f000206">This mean lord had been dreaming overnight of a silver bason and cup,</span> 
    <span id="f000207">and when Timon’s servant was announced,</span> 
    <span id="f000208">his sordid mind suggested to him that this was surely a making out of his dream,</span> 
    <span id="f000209">and that Timon had sent him such a present:</span> 
    <span id="f000210">but when he understood the truth of the matter,</span> 
    <span id="f000211">and that Timon wanted money,</span> 
    <span id="f000212">the quality of his faint and watery friendship showed itself,</span> 
    <span id="f000213">for with many protestations he vowed to the servant that he had long foreseen the ruin of his master’s affairs,</span> 
    <span id="f000214">and many a time had he come to dinner to tell him of it,</span> 
    <span id="f000215">and had come again to supper to try to persuade him to spend less,</span> 
    <span id="f000216">but he would take no counsel nor warning by his coming:</span> 
    <span id="f000217">and true it was that he had been a constant attender (as he said) at Timon’s feasts,</span> 
    <span id="f000218">as he had in greater things tasted his bounty;</span> 
    <span id="f000219">but that he ever came with that intent,</span> 
    <span id="f000220">or gave good counsel or reproof to Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000221">was a base unworthy lie,</span> 
    <span id="f000222">which he suitably followed up with meanly offering the servant a bribe,</span> 
    <span id="f000223">to go home to his master and tell him that he had not found Lucullus at home.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000224">As little success had the messenger who was sent to lord Lucius.</span> 
    <span id="f000225">This lying lord,</span> 
    <span id="f000226">who was full of Timon’s meat,</span> 
    <span id="f000227">and enriched almost to bursting with Timon’s costly presents,</span> 
    <span id="f000228">when he found the wind changed,</span> 
    <span id="f000229">and the fountain of so much bounty suddenly stopped,</span> 
    <span id="f000230">at first could hardly believe it;</span> 
    <span id="f000231">but on its being confirmed,</span> 
    <span id="f000232">he affected great regret that he should not have it in his power to serve lord Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000233">for unfortunately (which was a base falsehood) he had made a great purchase the day before,</span> 
    <span id="f000234">which had quite disfurnished him of the means at present,</span> 
    <span id="f000235">the more beast he,</span> 
    <span id="f000236">he called himself,</span> 
    <span id="f000237">to put it out of his power to serve so good a friend;</span> 
    <span id="f000238">and he counted it one of his greatest afflictions that his ability should fail him to pleasure such an honourable gentleman.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000239">Who can call any man friend that dips in the same dish with him?</span> 
    <span id="f000240">just of this metal is every flatterer.</span> 
    <span id="f000241">In the recollection of everybody Timon had been a father to this Lucius,</span> 
    <span id="f000242">had kept up his credit with his purse;</span> 
    <span id="f000243">Timon’s money had gone to pay the wages of his servants,</span> 
    <span id="f000244">to pay the hire of the labourers who had sweat to build the fine houses which Lucius’s pride had made necessary to him:</span> 
    <span id="f000245">yet,</span> 
    <span id="f000246">oh!</span> 
    <span id="f000247">the monster which man makes himself when he proves ungrateful!</span> 
    <span id="f000248">this Lucius now denied to Timon a sum,</span> 
    <span id="f000249">which,</span> 
    <span id="f000250">in respect of what Timon had bestowed on him,</span> 
    <span id="f000251">was less than charitable men afford to beggars.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000252">Sempronius,</span> 
    <span id="f000253">and every one of these mercenary lords to whom Timon applied in their turn,</span> 
    <span id="f000254">returned the same evasive answer or direct denial;</span> 
    <span id="f000255">even Ventidius,</span> 
    <span id="f000256">the redeemed and now rich Ventidius,</span> 
    <span id="f000257">refused to assist him with the loan of those five talents which Timon had not lent but generously given him in his distress.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000258">Now was Timon as much avoided in his poverty as he had been courted and resorted to in his riches.</span> 
    <span id="f000259">Now the same tongues which had been loudest in his praises,</span> 
    <span id="f000260">extolling him as bountiful,</span> 
    <span id="f000261">liberal,</span> 
    <span id="f000262">and open handed,</span> 
    <span id="f000263">were not ashamed to censure that very bounty as folly,</span> 
    <span id="f000264">that liberality as profuseness,</span> 
    <span id="f000265">though it had shown itself folly in nothing so truly as in the selection of such unworthy creatures as themselves for its objects.</span> 
    <span id="f000266">Now was Timon’s princely mansion forsaken,</span> 
    <span id="f000267">and become a shunned and hated place,</span> 
    <span id="f000268">a place for men to pass by,</span> 
    <span id="f000269">not a place,</span> 
    <span id="f000270">as formerly,</span> 
    <span id="f000271">where every passenger must stop and taste of his wine and good cheer;</span> 
    <span id="f000272">now,</span> 
    <span id="f000273">instead of being thronged with feasting and tumultuous guests,</span> 
    <span id="f000274">it was beset with impatient and clamorous creditors,</span> 
    <span id="f000275">usurers,</span> 
    <span id="f000276">extortioners,</span> 
    <span id="f000277">fierce and intolerable in their demands,</span> 
    <span id="f000278">pleading bonds,</span> 
    <span id="f000279">interest,</span> 
    <span id="f000280">mortgages;</span> 
    <span id="f000281">iron-hearted men that would take no denial nor putting off,</span> 
    <span id="f000282">that Timon’s house was now his jail,</span> 
    <span id="f000283">which he could not pass,</span> 
    <span id="f000284">nor go in nor out for them;</span> 
    <span id="f000285">one demanding his due of fifty talents,</span> 
    <span id="f000286">another bringing in a bill of five thousand crowns,</span> 
    <span id="f000287">which if he would tell out his blood by drops,</span> 
    <span id="f000288">and pay them so,</span> 
    <span id="f000289">he had not enough in his body to discharge,</span> 
    <span id="f000290">drop by drop.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000291">In this desperate and irremediable state (as it seemed) of his affairs,</span> 
    <span id="f000292">the eyes of all men were suddenly surprised at a new and incredible lustre which this setting sun put forth.</span> 
    <span id="f000293">Once more lord Timon proclaimed a feast,</span> 
    <span id="f000294">to which he invited his accustomed guests,</span> 
    <span id="f000295">lords,</span> 
    <span id="f000296">ladies,</span> 
    <span id="f000297">all that was great or fashionable in Athens.</span> 
    <span id="f000298">Lord Lucius and Lucullus came,</span> 
    <span id="f000299">Ventidius,</span> 
    <span id="f000300">Sempronius,</span> 
    <span id="f000301">and the rest.</span> 
    <span id="f000302">Who more sorry now than these fawning wretches,</span> 
    <span id="f000303">when they found (as they thought) that Lord Timon’s poverty was all pretence,</span> 
    <span id="f000304">and had been only to make trial of their loves,</span> 
    <span id="f000305">to think that they should not have seen through the artifice at the time,</span> 
    <span id="f000306">and have had the cheap credit of obliging his lordship?</span> 
    <span id="f000307">yet who more glad to find the fountain of that noble bounty,</span> 
    <span id="f000308">which they had thought dried up,</span> 
    <span id="f000309">still fresh and running?</span> 
    <span id="f000310">They came dissembling,</span> 
    <span id="f000311">protesting,</span> 
    <span id="f000312">expressing deepest sorrow and shame,</span> 
    <span id="f000313">that when his lordship sent to them,</span> 
    <span id="f000314">they should have been so unfortunate as to want the present means to oblige so honourable a friend.</span> 
    <span id="f000315">But Timon begged them not to give such trifles a thought,</span> 
    <span id="f000316">for he had altogether forgotten it.</span> 
    <span id="f000317">And these base fawning lords,</span> 
    <span id="f000318">though they had denied him money in his adversity,</span> 
    <span id="f000319">yet could not refuse their presence at this new blaze of his returning prosperity.</span> 
    <span id="f000320">For the swallow follows not summer more willingly than men of these dispositions follow the good fortunes of the great,</span> 
    <span id="f000321">nor more willingly leaves winter than these shrink from the first appearance of a reverse;</span> 
    <span id="f000322">such summer birds are men.</span> 
    <span id="f000323">But now with music and state the banquet of smoking dishes was served up;</span> 
    <span id="f000324">and when the guests had a little done admiring whence the bankrupt Timon could find means to furnish so costly a feast,</span> 
    <span id="f000325">some doubting whether the scene which they saw was real,</span> 
    <span id="f000326">as scarce trusting their own eyes;</span> 
    <span id="f000327">at a signal given,</span> 
    <span id="f000328">the dishes were uncovered,</span> 
    <span id="f000329">and Timon’s drift appeared:</span> 
    <span id="f000330">instead of those varieties and far-fetched dainties which they expected,</span> 
    <span id="f000331">that Timon’s epicurean table in past times had so liberally presented,</span> 
    <span id="f000332">now appeared under the covers of these dishes a preparation more suitable to Timon’s poverty,</span> 
    <span id="f000333">nothing but a little smoke and lukewarm water,</span> 
    <span id="f000334">fit feast for this knot of mouth-friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000335">whose professions were indeed smoke,</span> 
    <span id="f000336">and their hearts lukewarm and slippery as the water with which Timon welcomed his astonished guests,</span> 
    <span id="f000337">bidding them,</span> 
    <span id="f000338">«Uncover,</span> 
    <span id="f000339">dogs,</span> 
    <span id="f000340">and lap»;</span> 
    <span id="f000341">and before they could recover their surprise,</span> 
    <span id="f000342">sprinkling it in their faces,</span> 
    <span id="f000343">that they might have enough,</span> 
    <span id="f000344">and throwing dishes and all after them,</span> 
    <span id="f000345">who now ran huddling out,</span> 
    <span id="f000346">lords,</span> 
    <span id="f000347">ladies,</span> 
    <span id="f000348">with their caps snatched up in haste,</span> 
    <span id="f000349">a splendid confusion,</span> 
    <span id="f000350">Timon pursuing them,</span> 
    <span id="f000351">still calling them what they were,</span> 
    <span id="f000352">«smooth smiling parasites,</span> 
    <span id="f000353">destroyers under the mask of courtesy,</span> 
    <span id="f000354">affable wolves,</span> 
    <span id="f000355">meek bears,</span> 
    <span id="f000356">fools of fortune,</span> 
    <span id="f000357">feast-friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000358">time-flies.» They,</span> 
    <span id="f000359">crowding out to avoid him,</span> 
    <span id="f000360">left the house more willingly than they had entered it;</span> 
    <span id="f000361">some losing their gowns and caps,</span> 
    <span id="f000362">and some their jewels in the hurry,</span> 
    <span id="f000363">all glad to escape out of the presence of such a mad lord,</span> 
    <span id="f000364">and from the ridicule of his mock banquet.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000365">This was the last feast which ever Timon made,</span> 
    <span id="f000366">and in it he took farewell of Athens and the society of men;</span> 
    <span id="f000367">for,</span> 
    <span id="f000368">after that,</span> 
    <span id="f000369">he betook himself to the woods,</span> 
    <span id="f000370">turning his back upon the hated city and upon all mankind,</span> 
    <span id="f000371">wishing the walls of that detestable city might sink,</span> 
    <span id="f000372">and the houses fall upon their owners,</span> 
    <span id="f000373">wishing all plagues which infest humanity,</span> 
    <span id="f000374">war,</span> 
    <span id="f000375">outrage,</span> 
    <span id="f000376">poverty,</span> 
    <span id="f000377">diseases,</span> 
    <span id="f000378">might fasten upon its inhabitants,</span> 
    <span id="f000379">praying the just gods to confound all Athenians,</span> 
    <span id="f000380">both young and old,</span> 
    <span id="f000381">high and low;</span> 
    <span id="f000382">so wishing,</span> 
    <span id="f000383">he went to the woods,</span> 
    <span id="f000384">where he said he should find the unkindest beast much kinder than mankind.</span> 
    <span id="f000385">He stripped himself naked,</span> 
    <span id="f000386">that he might retain no fashion of a man,</span> 
    <span id="f000387">and dug a cave to live in,</span> 
    <span id="f000388">and lived solitary in the manner of a beast,</span> 
    <span id="f000389">eating the wild roots,</span> 
    <span id="f000390">and drinking water,</span> 
    <span id="f000391">flying from the face of his kind,</span> 
    <span id="f000392">and choosing rather to herd with wild beasts,</span> 
    <span id="f000393">as more harmless and friendly than man.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000394">What a change from lord Timon the rich,</span> 
    <span id="f000395">lord Timon the delight of mankind,</span> 
    <span id="f000396">to Timon the naked,</span> 
    <span id="f000397">Timon the man-hater!</span> 
    <span id="f000398">Where were his flatterers now?</span> 
    <span id="f000399">Where were his attendants and retinue?</span> 
    <span id="f000400">Would the bleak air,</span> 
    <span id="f000401">that boisterous servitor,</span> 
    <span id="f000402">be his chamberlain,</span> 
    <span id="f000403">to put his shirt on warm?</span> 
    <span id="f000404">Would those stiff trees that had outlived the eagle,</span> 
    <span id="f000405">turn young and airy pages to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000406">to skip on his errands when he bade them?</span> 
    <span id="f000407">Would the cool brook,</span> 
    <span id="f000408">when it was iced with winter,</span> 
    <span id="f000409">administer to him his warm broths and caudles when sick of an overnight’s surfeit?</span> 
    <span id="f000410">Or would the creatures that lived in those wild woods come and lick his hand and flatter him?</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000411">Here on a day,</span> 
    <span id="f000412">when he was digging for roots,</span> 
    <span id="f000413">his poor sustenance,</span> 
    <span id="f000414">his spade struck against something heavy,</span> 
    <span id="f000415">which proved to be gold,</span> 
    <span id="f000416">a great heap which some miser had probably buried in a time of alarm,</span> 
    <span id="f000417">thinking to have come again.</span> 
    <span id="f000418">and taken it from its prison,</span> 
    <span id="f000419">but died before the opportunity had arrived,</span> 
    <span id="f000420">without making any man privy to the concealment;</span> 
    <span id="f000421">so it lay,</span> 
    <span id="f000422">doing neither good nor harm,</span> 
    <span id="f000423">in the bowels of the earth,</span> 
    <span id="f000424">its mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000425">as if it had never come from thence,</span> 
    <span id="f000426">till the accidental striking of Timon’s spade against it once more brought it to light.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000427">Here was a mass of treasure which,</span> 
    <span id="f000428">if Timon had retained his old mind,</span> 
    <span id="f000429">was enough to have purchased him friends and flatterers again;</span> 
    <span id="f000430">but Timon was sick of the false world,</span> 
    <span id="f000431">and the sight of gold was poisonous to his eyes;</span> 
    <span id="f000432">and he would have restored it to the earth,</span> 
    <span id="f000433">but that,</span> 
    <span id="f000434">thinking of the infinite calamities which by means of gold happen to mankind,</span> 
    <span id="f000435">how the lucre of it causes robberies,</span> 
    <span id="f000436">oppression,</span> 
    <span id="f000437">injustice,</span> 
    <span id="f000438">briberies,</span> 
    <span id="f000439">violence,</span> 
    <span id="f000440">and murder,</span> 
    <span id="f000441">among men,</span> 
    <span id="f000442">he had a pleasure in imagining (such a rooted hatred did he bear to his species) that out of this heap,</span> 
    <span id="f000443">which in digging he had discovered,</span> 
    <span id="f000444">might arise some mischief to plague mankind.</span> 
    <span id="f000445">And some soldiers passing through the woods near to his cave at that instant,</span> 
    <span id="f000446">which proved to be a part of the troops of the Athenian captain Alcibiades,</span> 
    <span id="f000447">who upon some disgust taken against the senators of Athens (the Athenians were ever noted to be a thankless and ungrateful people,</span> 
    <span id="f000448">giving disgust to their generals and best friends),</span> 
    <span id="f000449">was marching at the head of the same triumphant army which he had formerly headed in their defence,</span> 
    <span id="f000450">to war against them;</span> 
    <span id="f000451">Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000452">who liked their business well,</span> 
    <span id="f000453">bestowed upon their captain the gold to pay his soldiers,</span> 
    <span id="f000454">requiring no other service from him,</span> 
    <span id="f000455">than that he should with his conquering army lay Athens level with the ground,</span> 
    <span id="f000456">and burn,</span> 
    <span id="f000457">slay,</span> 
    <span id="f000458">kill all her inhabitants;</span> 
    <span id="f000459">not sparing the old men for their white beards,</span> 
    <span id="f000460">for (he said) they were usurers,</span> 
    <span id="f000461">nor the young children for their seeming innocent smiles,</span> 
    <span id="f000462">for those (he said) would live,</span> 
    <span id="f000463">if they grew up,</span> 
    <span id="f000464">to be traitors;</span> 
    <span id="f000465">but to steel his eyes and ears against any sights or sounds that might awaken compassion;</span> 
    <span id="f000466">and not to let the cries of virgins,</span> 
    <span id="f000467">babes,</span> 
    <span id="f000468">or mothers.</span> 
    <span id="f000469">hinder him from making one universal massacre of the city,</span> 
    <span id="f000470">but to confound them all in his conquest;</span> 
    <span id="f000471">and when he had conquered,</span> 
    <span id="f000472">he prayed that the gods would confound him also,</span> 
    <span id="f000473">the conqueror:</span> 
    <span id="f000474">so thoroughly did Timon hate Athens,</span> 
    <span id="f000475">Athenians,</span> 
    <span id="f000476">and all mankind.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000477">While he lived in this forlorn state,</span> 
    <span id="f000478">leading a life more brutal than human,</span> 
    <span id="f000479">he was suddenly surprised one day with the appearance of a man standing in an admiring posture at the door of his cave.</span> 
    <span id="f000480">It was Flavius,</span> 
    <span id="f000481">the honest steward,</span> 
    <span id="f000482">whom love and zealous affection to his master had led to seek him out at his wretched dwelling,</span> 
    <span id="f000483">and to offer his services;</span> 
    <span id="f000484">and the first sight of his master,</span> 
    <span id="f000485">the once noble Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000486">in that abject condition,</span> 
    <span id="f000487">naked as he was born,</span> 
    <span id="f000488">living in the manner of a beast among beasts,</span> 
    <span id="f000489">looking like his own sad ruins and a monument of decay,</span> 
    <span id="f000490">so affected this good servant,</span> 
    <span id="f000491">that he stood speechless,</span> 
    <span id="f000492">wrapped up in horror,</span> 
    <span id="f000493">and confounded.</span> 
    <span id="f000494">And when he found utterance at last to his words,</span> 
    <span id="f000495">they were so choked with tears,</span> 
    <span id="f000496">that Timon had much ado to know him again,</span> 
    <span id="f000497">or to make out who it was that had come (so contrary to the experience he had had of mankind) to offer him service in extremity.</span> 
    <span id="f000498">And being in the form and shape of a man,</span> 
    <span id="f000499">he suspected him for a traitor,</span> 
    <span id="f000500">and his tears for false;</span> 
    <span id="f000501">but the good servant by so many tokens confirmed the truth of his fidelity,</span> 
    <span id="f000502">and made it clear that nothing but love and zealous duty to his once dear master had brought him there,</span> 
    <span id="f000503">that Timon was forced to confess that the world contained one honest man;</span> 
    <span id="f000504">yet,</span> 
    <span id="f000505">being in the shape and form of a man,</span> 
    <span id="f000506">he could not look upon his man’s face without abhorrence,</span> 
    <span id="f000507">or hear words uttered from his man’s lips without loathing;</span> 
    <span id="f000508">and this singly honest man was forced to depart,</span> 
    <span id="f000509">because he was a man,</span> 
    <span id="f000510">and because,</span> 
    <span id="f000511">with a heart more gentle and compassionate than is usual to man,</span> 
    <span id="f000512">he bore man’s detested form and outward feature.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000513">But greater visitants than a poor steward were about to interrupt the savage quiet of Timon’s solitude.</span> 
    <span id="f000514">For now the day was come when the ungrateful lords of Athens sorely repented the injustice which they had done to the noble Timon.</span> 
    <span id="f000515">For Alcibiades,</span> 
    <span id="f000516">like an incensed wild boar,</span> 
    <span id="f000517">was raging at the walls of their city,</span> 
    <span id="f000518">and with his hot siege threatened to lay fair Athens in the dust.</span> 
    <span id="f000519">And now the memory of lord Timon’s former prowess and military conduct came fresh into their forgetful minds,</span> 
    <span id="f000520">for Timon had been their general in past times,</span> 
    <span id="f000521">and a valiant and expert soldier,</span> 
    <span id="f000522">who alone of all the Athenians was deemed able to cope with a besieging army such as then threatened them,</span> 
    <span id="f000523">or to drive back the furious approaches of Alcibiades.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000524">A deputation of the senators was chosen in this emergency to wait upon Timon.</span> 
    <span id="f000525">To him they come in their extremity,</span> 
    <span id="f000526">to whom,</span> 
    <span id="f000527">when he was in extremity they had shown but small regard;</span> 
    <span id="f000528">as if they presumed upon his gratitude whom they had disobliged,</span> 
    <span id="f000529">and had derived a claim to his courtesy from their own most discourteous and unpiteous treatment.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000530">Now they earnestly beseech him,</span> 
    <span id="f000531">implore him with tears,</span> 
    <span id="f000532">to return and save that city,</span> 
    <span id="f000533">from which their ingratitude had so lately driven him;</span> 
    <span id="f000534">now they offer him riches,</span> 
    <span id="f000535">power,</span> 
    <span id="f000536">dignities,</span> 
    <span id="f000537">satisfaction for past injuries,</span> 
    <span id="f000538">and public honours,</span> 
    <span id="f000539">and the public love;</span> 
    <span id="f000540">their persons,</span> 
    <span id="f000541">lives,</span> 
    <span id="f000542">and fortunes,</span> 
    <span id="f000543">to be at his disposal,</span> 
    <span id="f000544">if he will but come back and save them.</span> 
    <span id="f000545">But Timon the naked,</span> 
    <span id="f000546">Timon the man-hater,</span> 
    <span id="f000547">was no longer lord Timon,</span> 
    <span id="f000548">the lord of bounty,</span> 
    <span id="f000549">the flower of valour,</span> 
    <span id="f000550">their defence in war,</span> 
    <span id="f000551">their ornament in peace.</span> 
    <span id="f000552">If Alcibiades killed his countrymen,</span> 
    <span id="f000553">Timon cared not.</span> 
    <span id="f000554">If he sacked fair Athens,</span> 
    <span id="f000555">and slew her old men and her infants,</span> 
    <span id="f000556">Timon would rejoice.</span> 
    <span id="f000557">So he told them;</span> 
    <span id="f000558">and that there was not a knife in the unruly camp which he did not prize above the reverendest throat in Athens.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000559">This was all the answer he vouchsafed to the weeping disappointed senators;</span> 
    <span id="f000560">only at parting he bade them commend him to his countrymen,</span> 
    <span id="f000561">and tell them,</span> 
    <span id="f000562">that to ease them of their griefs and anxieties,</span> 
    <span id="f000563">and to prevent the consequences of fierce Alcibiades’ wrath,</span> 
    <span id="f000564">there was yet a way left,</span> 
    <span id="f000565">which he would teach them,</span> 
    <span id="f000566">for he had yet so much affection left for his dear countrymen as to be willing to do them a kindness before his death.</span> 
    <span id="f000567">These words a little revived the senators,</span> 
    <span id="f000568">who hoped that his kindness for their city was returning.</span> 
    <span id="f000569">Then Timon told them that he had a tree,</span> 
    <span id="f000570">which grew near his cave,</span> 
    <span id="f000571">which he should shortly have occasion to cut down,</span> 
    <span id="f000572">and he invited all his friends in Athens,</span> 
    <span id="f000573">high or low,</span> 
    <span id="f000574">of what degree soever,</span> 
    <span id="f000575">who wished to shun affliction,</span> 
    <span id="f000576">to come and take a taste of his tree before he cut it down;</span> 
    <span id="f000577">meaning,</span> 
    <span id="f000578">that they might come and hang themselves on it,</span> 
    <span id="f000579">and escape affliction that way.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000580">And this was the last courtesy of all his noble bounties,</span> 
    <span id="f000581">which Timon showed to mankind,</span> 
    <span id="f000582">and this the last sight of him which his countrymen had:</span> 
    <span id="f000583">for not many days after,</span> 
    <span id="f000584">a poor soldier,</span> 
    <span id="f000585">passing by the sea-beach,</span> 
    <span id="f000586">which was at a little distance from the woods which Timon frequented,</span> 
    <span id="f000587">found a tomb on the verge of the sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000588">with an inscription upon it,</span> 
    <span id="f000589">purporting that it was the grave of Timon the manhater,</span> 
    <span id="f000590">who «While he lived,</span> 
    <span id="f000591">did hate all living men,</span> 
    <span id="f000592">and dying wished a plague might consume all caitiffs left!»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000593">Whether he finished his life by violence,</span> 
    <span id="f000594">or whether mere distaste of life and the loathing he had for mankind brought Timon to his conclusion,</span> 
    <span id="f000595">was not clear,</span> 
    <span id="f000596">yet all men admired the fitness of his epitaph,</span> 
    <span id="f000597">and the consistency of his end;</span> 
    <span id="f000598">dying,</span> 
    <span id="f000599">as he had lived,</span> 
    <span id="f000600">a hater of mankind:</span> 
    <span id="f000601">and some there were who fancied a conceit in the very choice which he had made of the sea-beach for his place of burial,</span> 
    <span id="f000602">where the vast sea might weep for ever upon his grave,</span> 
    <span id="f000603">as in contempt of the transient and shallow tears of hypocritical and deceitful mankind.</span></p>
