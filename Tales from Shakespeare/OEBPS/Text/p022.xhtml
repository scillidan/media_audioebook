   <p><span id="f000002">Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000003">prince of Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000004">became a voluntary exile from his dominions,</span> 
    <span id="f000005">to avert the dreadful calamities which Antiochus,</span> 
    <span id="f000006">the wicked emperor of Greece,</span> 
    <span id="f000007">threatened to bring upon his subjects and city of Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000008">in revenge for a discovery which the prince had made of a shocking deed which the emperor had done in secret;</span> 
    <span id="f000009">as commonly it proves dangerous to pry into the hidden crimes of great ones.</span> 
    <span id="f000010">Leaving the government of his people in the hands of his able and honest minister,</span> 
    <span id="f000011">Helicanus,</span> 
    <span id="f000012">Pericles set sail from Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000013">thinking to absent himself till the wrath of Antiochus,</span> 
    <span id="f000014">who was mighty,</span> 
    <span id="f000015">should be appeased.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000016">The first place which the prince directed his course to was Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000017">and hearing that the city of Tarsus was at that time suffering under a severe famine,</span> 
    <span id="f000018">he took with him store of provisions for its relief.</span> 
    <span id="f000019">On his arrival he found the city reduced to the utmost distress;</span> 
    <span id="f000020">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000021">he coming like a messenger from heaven with his unhoped-for succour,</span> 
    <span id="f000022">Cleon,</span> 
    <span id="f000023">the governor of Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000024">welcomed him with boundless thanks.</span> 
    <span id="f000025">Pericles had not been here many days,</span> 
    <span id="f000026">before letters came from his faithful minister,</span> 
    <span id="f000027">warning him that it was not safe for him to stay at Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000028">for Antiochus knew of his abode,</span> 
    <span id="f000029">and by secret emissaries despatched for that purpose sought his life.</span> 
    <span id="f000030">Upon receipt of these letters Pericles put out to sea again,</span> 
    <span id="f000031">amidst the blessings and prayers of a whole people who had been fed by his bounty.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000032">He had not sailed far,</span> 
    <span id="f000033">when his ship was overtaken by a dreadful storm,</span> 
    <span id="f000034">and every man on board perished except Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000035">who was cast by the sea-waves naked on an unknown shore,</span> 
    <span id="f000036">where he had not wandered long before he met with some poor fishermen,</span> 
    <span id="f000037">who invited him to their homes,</span> 
    <span id="f000038">giving him clothes and provisions.</span> 
    <span id="f000039">The fishermen told Pericles the name of their country was Pentapolis,</span> 
    <span id="f000040">and that their king was Simonides,</span> 
    <span id="f000041">commonly called the good Simonides,</span> 
    <span id="f000042">because of his peaceable reign and good government.</span> 
    <span id="f000043">From them he also learned that king Simonides had a fair young daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000044">and that the following day was her birthday,</span> 
    <span id="f000045">when a grand tournament was to be held at court,</span> 
    <span id="f000046">many princes and knights being come from all parts to try their skill in arms for the love of Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000047">this fair princess.</span> 
    <span id="f000048">While the prince was listening to this account,</span> 
    <span id="f000049">and secretly lamenting the loss of his good armour,</span> 
    <span id="f000050">which disabled him from making one among these valiant knights,</span> 
    <span id="f000051">another fisherman brought in a complete suit of armour that he had taken out of the sea with his fishing-net,</span> 
    <span id="f000052">which proved to be the very armour he had lost.</span> 
    <span id="f000053">When Pericles beheld his own armour,</span> 
    <span id="f000054">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000055">«Thanks,</span> 
    <span id="f000056">Fortune;</span> 
    <span id="f000057">after all my crosses you give me somewhat to repair myself.</span> 
    <span id="f000058">This armour was bequeathed to me by my dead father,</span> 
    <span id="f000059">for whose dear sake I have so loved it that whithersoever I went,</span> 
    <span id="f000060">I still have kept it by me,</span> 
    <span id="f000061">and the rough sea that parted it from me,</span> 
    <span id="f000062">having now become calm,</span> 
    <span id="f000063">hath given it back again,</span> 
    <span id="f000064">for which I thank it for,</span> 
    <span id="f000065">since I have my father’s gift again,</span> 
    <span id="f000066">I think my shipwreck no misfortune.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000067">The next day Pericles clad in his brave father’s armour,</span> 
    <span id="f000068">repaired to the royal court of Simonides,</span> 
    <span id="f000069">where he performed wonders at the tournament,</span> 
    <span id="f000070">vanquishing with ease all the brave knights and valiant princes who contended with him in arms for the honour of Thaisa’s love.</span> 
    <span id="f000071">When brave warriors contended at court tournaments for the love of king’s daughters,</span> 
    <span id="f000072">if one proved sole victor over all the rest,</span> 
    <span id="f000073">it was usual for the great lady for whose sake these deeds of valour were undertaken,</span> 
    <span id="f000074">to bestow all her respect upon the conqueror,</span> 
    <span id="f000075">and Thaisa did not depart from this custom,</span> 
    <span id="f000076">for she presently dismissed all the princes and knights whom Pericles had vanquished,</span> 
    <span id="f000077">and distinguished him by her especial favour and regard,</span> 
    <span id="f000078">crowning him with the wrath of victory,</span> 
    <span id="f000079">as king of that day’s happiness;</span> 
    <span id="f000080">and Pericles became a most passionate lover of this beauteous princess from the first moment he beheld her.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000081">The good Simonides so well approved of the valour and noble qualities of Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000082">who was indeed a most accomplished gentleman,</span> 
    <span id="f000083">and well learned in all excellent arts,</span> 
    <span id="f000084">that though he knew not the rank of this royal stranger (for Pericles for fear of Antiochus gave out that he was a private gentleman of Tyre),</span> 
    <span id="f000085">yet did not Simonides disdain to accept of the valiant unknown for a son-in-law,</span> 
    <span id="f000086">when he perceived his daughter’s affections were firmly fixed upon him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000087">Pericles had not been many months married to Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000088">before he received intelligence that his enemy Antiochus was dead,</span> 
    <span id="f000089">and that his subjects of Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000090">impatient of his long absence,</span> 
    <span id="f000091">threatened to revolt,</span> 
    <span id="f000092">and talked of placing Helicanus upon his vacant throne.</span> 
    <span id="f000093">This news came from Helicanus himself,</span> 
    <span id="f000094">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000095">being a loyal subject to his royal master,</span> 
    <span id="f000096">would not accept of the high dignity offered him,</span> 
    <span id="f000097">but sent to let Pericles know their intentions,</span> 
    <span id="f000098">that he might return home and resume his lawful right.</span> 
    <span id="f000099">It was matter of great surprise and joy to Simonides,</span> 
    <span id="f000100">to kind that his son-in-law (the obscure knight) was the renowned prince of Tyre;</span> 
    <span id="f000101">yet again he regretted that he was not the private gentleman he supposed him to be,</span> 
    <span id="f000102">seeing that he must now part both with his admired son-in-law and his beloved daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000103">whom he feared to trust to the perils of the sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000104">because Thaisa was with child;</span> 
    <span id="f000105">and Pericles himself wished her to remain with her father till after her confinement,</span> 
    <span id="f000106">but the poor lady so earnestly desired to go with her husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000107">that at last they consented,</span> 
    <span id="f000108">hoping she would reach Tyre before she was brought to bed.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000109">The sea was no friendly element to unhappy Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000110">for long before they reached Tyre another dreadful tempest arose,</span> 
    <span id="f000111">which so terrified Thaisa that she was taken ill,</span> 
    <span id="f000112">and in a short space of time her nurse Lychorida came to Pericles with a little child in her arms,</span> 
    <span id="f000113">to tell the prince the sad tidings that his wife died the moment her little babe was born.</span> 
    <span id="f000114">She held the babe towards its father,</span> 
    <span id="f000115">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000116">«Here is a thing too young for such a place.</span> 
    <span id="f000117">This is the child of your dead queen.» No tongue can tell the dreadful sufferings of Pericles when he heard his wife was dead.</span> 
    <span id="f000118">As soon as he could speak,</span> 
    <span id="f000119">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000120">«O you gods,</span> 
    <span id="f000121">why do you make us love your goodly gifts,</span> 
    <span id="f000122">and then snatch those gifts away?» «Patience,</span> 
    <span id="f000123">good sir,» said Lychorida,</span> 
    <span id="f000124">«here is all that is left alive of our dead queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000125">a little daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000126">and for your child’s sake be more manly.</span> 
    <span id="f000127">Patience,</span> 
    <span id="f000128">good sir,</span> 
    <span id="f000129">even for the sake of this precious charge.» Pericles took the new-born infant in his arms,</span> 
    <span id="f000130">and he said to the little babe:</span> 
    <span id="f000131">«Now may your life be mild,</span> 
    <span id="f000132">for a more blusterous birth had never babe!</span> 
    <span id="f000133">May your condition be mild and gentle,</span> 
    <span id="f000134">for you have had the rudest welcome that ever prince’s child did meet with!</span> 
    <span id="f000135">May that which follows be happy,</span> 
    <span id="f000136">for you have had as chiding a nativity as fire,</span> 
    <span id="f000137">air,</span> 
    <span id="f000138">water,</span> 
    <span id="f000139">earth,</span> 
    <span id="f000140">and heaven could make to herald you from the womb!</span> 
    <span id="f000141">Even at the first,</span> 
    <span id="f000142">your loss,» meaning in the death of her mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000143">«is more than all the joys,</span> 
    <span id="f000144">which you shall find upon this earth to which you are come a new visitor,</span> 
    <span id="f000145">shall be able to recompense.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000146">The storm still continuing to rage furiously,</span> 
    <span id="f000147">and the sailors having a superstition that while a dead body remained in the ship the storm would never cease,</span> 
    <span id="f000148">they came to Pericles to demand that his queen should be thrown overboard;</span> 
    <span id="f000149">and they said:</span> 
    <span id="f000150">«What courage,</span> 
    <span id="f000151">sir?</span> 
    <span id="f000152">God save you!» «Courage enough,» said the sorrowing prince:</span> 
    <span id="f000153">«I do not fear the storm;</span> 
    <span id="f000154">it has done to me its worst;</span> 
    <span id="f000155">yet for the love of this poor infant,</span> 
    <span id="f000156">this fresh new seafarer,</span> 
    <span id="f000157">I wish the storm was over.» «Sir,» said the sailors,</span> 
    <span id="f000158">«your queen must overboard.</span> 
    <span id="f000159">The sea works high,</span> 
    <span id="f000160">the wind is loud,</span> 
    <span id="f000161">and the storm will not abate till the ship be cleared of the dead.» Though Pericles knew how weak and unfounded this superstition was,</span> 
    <span id="f000162">yet he patiently submitted,</span> 
    <span id="f000163">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000164">«As you think meet.</span> 
    <span id="f000165">Then she must overboard,</span> 
    <span id="f000166">most wretched queen!» And now this unhappy prince went to take a last view of his dear wife,</span> 
    <span id="f000167">and as he looked on his Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000168">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000169">«A terrible childbed hast thou had,</span> 
    <span id="f000170">my dear;</span> 
    <span id="f000171">no light,</span> 
    <span id="f000172">no fire;</span> 
    <span id="f000173">the unfriendly elements forget thee utterly,</span> 
    <span id="f000174">nor have I time to bring thee hallowed to thy grave,</span> 
    <span id="f000175">but must cast thee scarcely coffined into the sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000176">where for a monument upon thy bones the humming waters must overwhelm thy corpse,</span> 
    <span id="f000177">lying with simple shells.</span> 
    <span id="f000178">O Lychorida,</span> 
    <span id="f000179">bid Nestor bring me spices,</span> 
    <span id="f000180">ink,</span> 
    <span id="f000181">and paper,</span> 
    <span id="f000182">my casket and my jewels,</span> 
    <span id="f000183">and bid Nicandor bring me the satin coffin.</span> 
    <span id="f000184">Lay the babe upon the pillow,</span> 
    <span id="f000185">and go about this suddenly,</span> 
    <span id="f000186">Lychorida,</span> 
    <span id="f000187">while I say a priestly farewell to my Thaisa.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000188">They brought Pericles a large chest,</span> 
    <span id="f000189">in which (wrapped in a satin shroud) he placed his queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000190">and sweet-smelling spices he strewed over her,</span> 
    <span id="f000191">and beside her he placed rich jewels,</span> 
    <span id="f000192">and a written paper,</span> 
    <span id="f000193">telling who she was,</span> 
    <span id="f000194">and praying if haply any one should find the chest which contained the body of his wife,</span> 
    <span id="f000195">they would give her burial:</span> 
    <span id="f000196">and then with his own hands he cast the chest into the sea.</span> 
    <span id="f000197">When the storm was over,</span> 
    <span id="f000198">Pericles ordered the sailors to make for Tarsus.</span> 
    <span id="f000199">«For,» said Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000200">«the babe cannot hold out till we come to Tyre.</span> 
    <span id="f000201">At Tarsus I will leave it at careful nursing.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000202">After that tempestuous night when Thaisa was thrown into the sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000203">and while it was yet early morning,</span> 
    <span id="f000204">as Cerimon,</span> 
    <span id="f000205">a worthy gentleman of Ephesus,</span> 
    <span id="f000206">and a most skilful physician,</span> 
    <span id="f000207">was standing by the sea-side,</span> 
    <span id="f000208">his servants brought to him a chest,</span> 
    <span id="f000209">which they said the sea-waves had thrown on the land.</span> 
    <span id="f000210">«I never saw,» said one of them,</span> 
    <span id="f000211">«so huge a billow as cast it on our shore.» Cerimon ordered the chest to be conveyed to his own house and when it was opened he beheld with wonder the body of a young and lovely lady;</span> 
    <span id="f000212">and the sweet-smelling spices and rich casket of jewels made him conclude it was some great person who was thus strangely entombed:</span> 
    <span id="f000213">searching farther,</span> 
    <span id="f000214">he discovered a paper,</span> 
    <span id="f000215">from which he learned that the corpse which lay as dead before him had been a queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000216">and wife to Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000217">prince of Tyre;</span> 
    <span id="f000218">and much admiring at the strangeness of that accident,</span> 
    <span id="f000219">and more pitying the husband who had lost this sweet lady,</span> 
    <span id="f000220">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000221">«If you are living,</span> 
    <span id="f000222">Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000223">you have a heart that even cracks with woe.» Then observing attentively Thaisa’s face,</span> 
    <span id="f000224">he saw how fresh and unlike death her looks were,</span> 
    <span id="f000225">and he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000226">«They were too hasty that threw you into the sea»:</span> 
    <span id="f000227">for he did not believe her to be dead.</span> 
    <span id="f000228">He ordered a fire to be made,</span> 
    <span id="f000229">and proper cordials to be brought,</span> 
    <span id="f000230">and soft music to be played,</span> 
    <span id="f000231">which might help to calm her amazed spirits if she should revive;</span> 
    <span id="f000232">and he said to those who crowded round her,</span> 
    <span id="f000233">wondering at what they saw:</span> 
    <span id="f000234">«I pray you,</span> 
    <span id="f000235">gentlemen,</span> 
    <span id="f000236">give her air;</span> 
    <span id="f000237">this queen will live;</span> 
    <span id="f000238">she has not been entranced above five hours;</span> 
    <span id="f000239">and see,</span> 
    <span id="f000240">she begins to blow into life again;</span> 
    <span id="f000241">she is alive;</span> 
    <span id="f000242">behold,</span> 
    <span id="f000243">her eyelids move;</span> 
    <span id="f000244">this fair creature will live to make us weep to hear her fate.» Thaisa had never died,</span> 
    <span id="f000245">but after the birth of her little baby had fallen into a deep swoon,</span> 
    <span id="f000246">which made all that saw her conclude her to be dead;</span> 
    <span id="f000247">and now by the care of this kind gentleman she once more revived to light and life;</span> 
    <span id="f000248">and opening her eyes,</span> 
    <span id="f000249">she said:</span> 
    <span id="f000250">«Where am I?</span> 
    <span id="f000251">Where is my lord?</span> 
    <span id="f000252">What world is this?» By gentle degrees Cerimon let her understand what had befallen her;</span> 
    <span id="f000253">and when he thought she was enough recovered to bear the sight,</span> 
    <span id="f000254">he showed her the paper written by her husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000255">and the jewels;</span> 
    <span id="f000256">and she looked on the paper,</span> 
    <span id="f000257">and said:</span> 
    <span id="f000258">«It is my lord’s writing.</span> 
    <span id="f000259">That I was shipped at sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000260">I well remember,</span> 
    <span id="f000261">but whether there delivered of my babe,</span> 
    <span id="f000262">by the holy gods I cannot rightly say;</span> 
    <span id="f000263">but since my wedded lord I never shall see again,</span> 
    <span id="f000264">I will put on a vestal livery,</span> 
    <span id="f000265">and never more have joy.» «Madam,» said Cerimon,</span> 
    <span id="f000266">«if you purpose as you speak,</span> 
    <span id="f000267">the temple of Diana is not far distant from hence;</span> 
    <span id="f000268">there you may abide as a vestal.</span> 
    <span id="f000269">Moreover,</span> 
    <span id="f000270">if you please,</span> 
    <span id="f000271">a niece of mine shall there attend you.» This proposal was accepted with thanks by Thaisa;</span> 
    <span id="f000272">and when she was perfectly recovered,</span> 
    <span id="f000273">Cerimon placed her in the temple of Diana,</span> 
    <span id="f000274">where she became a vestal or priestess of that goddess,</span> 
    <span id="f000275">and passed her days in sorrowing for her husband’s supposed loss,</span> 
    <span id="f000276">and in the most devout exercises of those times.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000277">Pericles carried his young daughter (whom he named Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000278">because she was born at sea) to Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000279">intending to leave her with Cleon,</span> 
    <span id="f000280">the governor of that city,</span> 
    <span id="f000281">and his wife Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000282">thinking,</span> 
    <span id="f000283">for the good he had done to them at the time of their famine,</span> 
    <span id="f000284">they would be kind to his little motherless daughter.</span> 
    <span id="f000285">When Cleon saw prince Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000286">and heard of the great loss which had befallen him,</span> 
    <span id="f000287">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000288">«O your sweet queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000289">that it had pleased Heaven you could have brought her hither to have blessed my eyes with the sight of her!» Pericles replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000290">«We must obey the powers above us.</span> 
    <span id="f000291">Should I rage and roar as the sea does in which my Thaisa lies,</span> 
    <span id="f000292">yet the end must be as it is.</span> 
    <span id="f000293">My gentle babe,</span> 
    <span id="f000294">Marina here,</span> 
    <span id="f000295">I must charge your charity with her.</span> 
    <span id="f000296">I leave her the infant of your care,</span> 
    <span id="f000297">beseeching you to give her princely training.» And then turning to Cleon’s wife,</span> 
    <span id="f000298">Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000299">he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000300">«Good madam,</span> 
    <span id="f000301">make me blessed in your care in bringing up my child»:</span> 
    <span id="f000302">and she answered:</span> 
    <span id="f000303">«I have a child myself who shall not be more dear to my respect than yours,</span> 
    <span id="f000304">my lord»;</span> 
    <span id="f000305">and Cleon made the like promise,</span> 
    <span id="f000306">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000307">«Your noble services,</span> 
    <span id="f000308">prince Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000309">in feeding my whole people with your corn (for which in their prayers they daily remember you) must in your child be thought on.</span> 
    <span id="f000310">If I should neglect your child,</span> 
    <span id="f000311">my whole people that were by you relieved would force me to my duty;</span> 
    <span id="f000312">but if to that I need a spur,</span> 
    <span id="f000313">the gods revenge it on me and mine to the end of generation.» Pericles being thus assured that his child would be carefully attended to,</span> 
    <span id="f000314">left her to the protection of Cleon and his wife Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000315">and with her he left the nurse Lychorida.</span> 
    <span id="f000316">When he went away,</span> 
    <span id="f000317">the little Marina knew not her loss,</span> 
    <span id="f000318">but Lychorida wept sadly at parting with her royal master.</span> 
    <span id="f000319">«O,</span> 
    <span id="f000320">no tears,</span> 
    <span id="f000321">Lychorida,» said Pericles:</span> 
    <span id="f000322">«no tears;</span> 
    <span id="f000323">look to your little mistress,</span> 
    <span id="f000324">on whose grace you may depend hereafter.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000325">Pericles arrived in safety at Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000326">and was once more settled in the quiet possession of his throne,</span> 
    <span id="f000327">while his woeful queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000328">whom he thought dead,</span> 
    <span id="f000329">remained at Ephesus.</span> 
    <span id="f000330">Her little babe Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000331">whom this hapless mother had never seen,</span> 
    <span id="f000332">was brought up by Cleon in a manner suitable to her high birth.</span> 
    <span id="f000333">He gave her the most careful education,</span> 
    <span id="f000334">so that by the time Marina attained the age of fourteen years,</span> 
    <span id="f000335">the most deeply-learned men were not more studied in the learning of those times than was Marina.</span> 
    <span id="f000336">She sang like one immortal,</span> 
    <span id="f000337">and danced as goddesslike,</span> 
    <span id="f000338">and with her needle she was so skilful that she seemed to compose nature’s own shapes,</span> 
    <span id="f000339">in birds,</span> 
    <span id="f000340">fruits,</span> 
    <span id="f000341">or flowers,</span> 
    <span id="f000342">the natural roses being scarcely more like to each other than they were to Marina’s silken flowers.</span> 
    <span id="f000343">But when she had gained from education all these graces,</span> 
    <span id="f000344">which made her the general wonder,</span> 
    <span id="f000345">Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000346">the wife of Cleon,</span> 
    <span id="f000347">became her mortal enemy from jealousy,</span> 
    <span id="f000348">by reason that her own daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000349">from the slowness of her mind,</span> 
    <span id="f000350">was not able to attain to that perfection wherein Marina excelled:</span> 
    <span id="f000351">and finding that all praise was bestowed on Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000352">whilst her daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000353">who was of the same age,</span> 
    <span id="f000354">and had been educated with the same care as Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000355">though not with the same success,</span> 
    <span id="f000356">was in comparison disregarded,</span> 
    <span id="f000357">she formed a project to remove Marina out of the way,</span> 
    <span id="f000358">vainly imagining that her untoward daughter would be more respected when Marina was no more seen.</span> 
    <span id="f000359">To encompass this she employed a man to murder Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000360">and she well timed her wicked design,</span> 
    <span id="f000361">when Lychorida,</span> 
    <span id="f000362">the faithful nurse,</span> 
    <span id="f000363">had just died.</span> 
    <span id="f000364">Dionysia was discoursing with the man she had commanded to commit this murder,</span> 
    <span id="f000365">when the young Marina was weeping over the dead Lychorida.</span> 
    <span id="f000366">Leonine,</span> 
    <span id="f000367">the man she employed to do this bad deed,</span> 
    <span id="f000368">though he was a very wicked man,</span> 
    <span id="f000369">could hardly be persuaded to undertake it,</span> 
    <span id="f000370">so had Marina won all hearts to love her.</span> 
    <span id="f000371">He said:</span> 
    <span id="f000372">«She is a goodly creature!» «The tatter then the gods should have her,» replied her merciless enemy:</span> 
    <span id="f000373">«here she comes weeping for the death of her nurse Lychorida:</span> 
    <span id="f000374">are you resolved to obey me?» Leonine,</span> 
    <span id="f000375">fearing to disobey her,</span> 
    <span id="f000376">replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000377">«I am resolved.» And so,</span> 
    <span id="f000378">in that one short sentence,</span> 
    <span id="f000379">was the matchless Marina doomed to an untimely death.</span> 
    <span id="f000380">She now approached,</span> 
    <span id="f000381">with a basket of flowers in her hand,</span> 
    <span id="f000382">which she said she would daily strew over the grave of good Lychorida.</span> 
    <span id="f000383">The purple violet and the marigold should as a carpet hang upon her grave,</span> 
    <span id="f000384">while summer days did last.</span> 
    <span id="f000385">«Alas,</span> 
    <span id="f000386">for me!» she said,</span> 
    <span id="f000387">«poor unhappy maid,</span> 
    <span id="f000388">born in a tempest,</span> 
    <span id="f000389">when my mother died.</span> 
    <span id="f000390">This world to me is like a lasting storm,</span> 
    <span id="f000391">hurrying me from my friends.» «How now,</span> 
    <span id="f000392">Marina,» said the dissembling Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000393">«do you weep alone?</span> 
    <span id="f000394">How does it chance my daughter is not with you?</span> 
    <span id="f000395">Do not sorrow for Lychorida,</span> 
    <span id="f000396">you have a nurse in me.</span> 
    <span id="f000397">Your beauty is quite changed with this unprofitable woe.</span> 
    <span id="f000398">Come,</span> 
    <span id="f000399">give me your flowers,</span> 
    <span id="f000400">the sea-air will spoil them;</span> 
    <span id="f000401">and walk with Leonine:</span> 
    <span id="f000402">the air is fine,</span> 
    <span id="f000403">and will enliven you.</span> 
    <span id="f000404">Come,</span> 
    <span id="f000405">Leonine,</span> 
    <span id="f000406">take her by the arm,</span> 
    <span id="f000407">and walk with her.» «No,</span> 
    <span id="f000408">madam,» said Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000409">«I pray you let me not deprive you of your servant»:</span> 
    <span id="f000410">for Leonine was one of Dionysia’s attendants.</span> 
    <span id="f000411">«Come,</span> 
    <span id="f000412">come,» said this artful woman,</span> 
    <span id="f000413">who wished for a presence to leave her alone with Leonine,</span> 
    <span id="f000414">«I love the prince,</span> 
    <span id="f000415">your father,</span> 
    <span id="f000416">and I love you.</span> 
    <span id="f000417">We every day expect your father here;</span> 
    <span id="f000418">and when he comes,</span> 
    <span id="f000419">and finds you so changed by grief from the paragon of beauty we reported you,</span> 
    <span id="f000420">he will think we have taken no care of you.</span> 
    <span id="f000421">Go,</span> 
    <span id="f000422">I pray you,</span> 
    <span id="f000423">walk,</span> 
    <span id="f000424">and be cheerful once again.</span> 
    <span id="f000425">Be careful of that excellent complexion,</span> 
    <span id="f000426">which stole the hearts of old and young.» Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000427">being thus importuned,</span> 
    <span id="f000428">said:</span> 
    <span id="f000429">«Well,</span> 
    <span id="f000430">I will go,</span> 
    <span id="f000431">but yet I have no desire to it.» As Dionysia walked away,</span> 
    <span id="f000432">she said to Leonine:</span> 
    <span id="f000433">«Remember what I have said!» — shocking words,</span> 
    <span id="f000434">for their meaning was that he should remember to kill Marina.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000435">Marina looked towards the sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000436">her birthplace,</span> 
    <span id="f000437">and said:</span> 
    <span id="f000438">«Is the wind westerly that blows?» «South-west,» replied Leonine.</span> 
    <span id="f000439">«When I was born the wind was north,» said she:</span> 
    <span id="f000440">and then the storm and tempest,</span> 
    <span id="f000441">and all her father’s sorrows,</span> 
    <span id="f000442">and her mother’s death,</span> 
    <span id="f000443">came full into her mind;</span> 
    <span id="f000444">and she said:</span> 
    <span id="f000445">«My father,</span> 
    <span id="f000446">as Lychorida told me,</span> 
    <span id="f000447">did never fear,</span> 
    <span id="f000448">but cried,</span> 
    <span id="f000449">Courage,</span> 
    <span id="f000450">good seamen,</span> 
    <span id="f000451">to the sailors,</span> 
    <span id="f000452">galling his princely hands with the ropes,</span> 
    <span id="f000453">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000454">clasping to the masts,</span> 
    <span id="f000455">he endured a sea that almost split the deck.» «When was this?» said Leonine.</span> 
    <span id="f000456">«When I was born,» replied Marina:</span> 
    <span id="f000457">«never were wind and waves more violent»;</span> 
    <span id="f000458">and then she described the storm,</span> 
    <span id="f000459">the action of the sailors,</span> 
    <span id="f000460">the boatswain’s whistle,</span> 
    <span id="f000461">and the loud call of the master,</span> 
    <span id="f000462">«which,» said she,</span> 
    <span id="f000463">«trebled the confusion of the ship.» Lychorida had so often recounted to Marina the story of her hapless birth that these things seemed ever present to her imagination.</span> 
    <span id="f000464">But here Leonine interrupted her with desiring her to say her prayers.</span> 
    <span id="f000465">«What mean you?» said Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000466">who began to fear,</span> 
    <span id="f000467">she knew not why.</span> 
    <span id="f000468">«If you require a little space for prayer,</span> 
    <span id="f000469">I grant it,» said Leonine;</span> 
    <span id="f000470">«but be not tedious,</span> 
    <span id="f000471">the gods are quick of ear,</span> 
    <span id="f000472">and I am sworn to do my work in haste.» «Will you kill me?» said Marina:</span> 
    <span id="f000473">«alas!</span> 
    <span id="f000474">why?» «To satisfy my lady,» replied Leonine.</span> 
    <span id="f000475">«Why would she have me killed?» said Marina:</span> 
    <span id="f000476">«now,</span> 
    <span id="f000477">as I can remember,</span> 
    <span id="f000478">I never hurt her in all my life.</span> 
    <span id="f000479">I never spake bad word,</span> 
    <span id="f000480">nor did any ill turn to any living creature.</span> 
    <span id="f000481">Believe me now,</span> 
    <span id="f000482">I never killed a mouse,</span> 
    <span id="f000483">nor hurt a fly.</span> 
    <span id="f000484">I trod upon a worm once against my will,</span> 
    <span id="f000485">but I wept for it.</span> 
    <span id="f000486">How have I offended?» The murderer replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000487">«My commission is not to reason on the deed,</span> 
    <span id="f000488">but to do it.» And he was just going to kill her,</span> 
    <span id="f000489">when certain pirates happened to land at that very moment,</span> 
    <span id="f000490">who seeing Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000491">bore her off as a prize to their ship.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000492">The pirate who had made Marina his prize carried her to Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000493">and sold her for a slave,</span> 
    <span id="f000494">where,</span> 
    <span id="f000495">though in that humble condition,</span> 
    <span id="f000496">Marina soon became known throughout the whole city of Mitylene for her beauty and her virtues;</span> 
    <span id="f000497">and the person to whom she was sold became rich by the money she earned for him.</span> 
    <span id="f000498">She taught music,</span> 
    <span id="f000499">dancing,</span> 
    <span id="f000500">and fine needleworks,</span> 
    <span id="f000501">and the money she got by her scholars she gave to her master and mistress;</span> 
    <span id="f000502">and the fame of her learning and her great industry came to the knowledge of Lysimachus,</span> 
    <span id="f000503">a young nobleman who was governor of Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000504">and Lysimachus went himself to the house where Marina dwelt,</span> 
    <span id="f000505">to see this paragon of excellence,</span> 
    <span id="f000506">whom all the city praised so highly.</span> 
    <span id="f000507">Her conversation delighted Lysimachus beyond measure,</span> 
    <span id="f000508">for though he had heard much of this admired maiden,</span> 
    <span id="f000509">he did not expect to find her so sensible a lady,</span> 
    <span id="f000510">so virtuous,</span> 
    <span id="f000511">and so good,</span> 
    <span id="f000512">as he perceived Marina to be;</span> 
    <span id="f000513">and he left her,</span> 
    <span id="f000514">saying,</span> 
    <span id="f000515">he hoped she would persevere in her industrious and virtuous course,</span> 
    <span id="f000516">and that if ever she heard from him again it should be for her good.</span> 
    <span id="f000517">Lysimachus thought Marina such a miracle for sense,</span> 
    <span id="f000518">fine breeding,</span> 
    <span id="f000519">and excellent qualities,</span> 
    <span id="f000520">as well as for beauty and all outward graces,</span> 
    <span id="f000521">that he wished to marry her,</span> 
    <span id="f000522">and notwithstanding her humble situation,</span> 
    <span id="f000523">he hoped to find that her birth was noble;</span> 
    <span id="f000524">but ever when they asked her parentage she would sit still and weep.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000525">Meantime,</span> 
    <span id="f000526">at Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000527">Leonine,</span> 
    <span id="f000528">fearing the anger of Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000529">told her he had killed Marina;</span> 
    <span id="f000530">and that wicked woman gave out that she was dead,</span> 
    <span id="f000531">and made a pretended funeral for her,</span> 
    <span id="f000532">and erected a stately monument;</span> 
    <span id="f000533">and shortly after Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000534">accompanied by his royal minister Helicanus,</span> 
    <span id="f000535">made a voyage from Tyre to Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000536">on purpose to see his daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000537">intending to take her home with him:</span> 
    <span id="f000538">and he never having beheld her since he left her an infant in the care of Cleon and his wife,</span> 
    <span id="f000539">how did this good prince rejoice at the thought of seeing this dear child of his buried queen!</span> 
    <span id="f000540">but when they told him Marina was dead,</span> 
    <span id="f000541">and showed the monument they had erected for her,</span> 
    <span id="f000542">great was the misery this most wretched father endured,</span> 
    <span id="f000543">and not being able to bear the sight of that country where his last hope and only memory of his dear Thaisa was entombed,</span> 
    <span id="f000544">he took ship,</span> 
    <span id="f000545">and hastily departed from Tarsus.</span> 
    <span id="f000546">From the day he entered the ship a dull and heavy melancholy seized him.</span> 
    <span id="f000547">He never spoke,</span> 
    <span id="f000548">and seemed totally insensible to everything around him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000549">Sailing from Tarsus to Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000550">the ship in its course passed by Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000551">where Marina dwelt;</span> 
    <span id="f000552">the governor of which place,</span> 
    <span id="f000553">Lysimachus,</span> 
    <span id="f000554">observing this royal vessel from the shore,</span> 
    <span id="f000555">and desirous of knowing who was on board,</span> 
    <span id="f000556">went in a barge to the side of the ship,</span> 
    <span id="f000557">to satisfy his curiosity.</span> 
    <span id="f000558">Helicanus received him very courteously and told him that the ship came from Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000559">and that they were conducting thither Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000560">their prince;</span> 
    <span id="f000561">«A man,</span> 
    <span id="f000562">sir,» said Helicanus,</span> 
    <span id="f000563">«who has not spoken to any one these three months,</span> 
    <span id="f000564">nor taken any sustenance,</span> 
    <span id="f000565">but just to prolong his grief;</span> 
    <span id="f000566">it would be tedious to repeat the whole ground of his distemper,</span> 
    <span id="f000567">but the main springs from the loss of a beloved daughter and a wife.» Lysimachus begged to see this afflicted prince,</span> 
    <span id="f000568">and when he beheld Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000569">he saw he had been once a goodly person,</span> 
    <span id="f000570">and he said to him:</span> 
    <span id="f000571">«Sir king,</span> 
    <span id="f000572">all hail,</span> 
    <span id="f000573">the gods preserve you,</span> 
    <span id="f000574">hail,</span> 
    <span id="f000575">royal sir!» But in vain Lysimachus spoke to him;</span> 
    <span id="f000576">Pericles made no answer,</span> 
    <span id="f000577">nor did he appear to perceive any stranger approached.</span> 
    <span id="f000578">And then Lysimachus bethought him of the peerless maid Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000579">that haply with her sweet tongue she might win some answer from the silent prince:</span> 
    <span id="f000580">and with the consent of Helicanus he sent for Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000581">and when she entered the ship in which her own father sat motionless with grief,</span> 
    <span id="f000582">they welcomed her on board as if they had known she was their princess;</span> 
    <span id="f000583">and they cried:</span> 
    <span id="f000584">«She is a gallant lady.» Lysimachus was well pleased to hear their commendations,</span> 
    <span id="f000585">and he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000586">«She is such a one,</span> 
    <span id="f000587">that were I well assured she came of noble birth,</span> 
    <span id="f000588">I would wish no better choice,</span> 
    <span id="f000589">and think me rarely blessed in a wife.» And then he addressed her in courtly terms,</span> 
    <span id="f000590">as if the lowly-seeming maid had been the high-born lady he wished to find her,</span> 
    <span id="f000591">calling her Fair and beautiful Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000592">telling her a great prince on board that ship had fallen into a sad and mournful silence;</span> 
    <span id="f000593">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000594">as if Marina had the power of conferring health and felicity,</span> 
    <span id="f000595">he begged she would undertake to cure the royal stranger of his melancholy.</span> 
    <span id="f000596">«Sir,» said Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000597">«I will use my utmost skill in his recovery,</span> 
    <span id="f000598">provided none but I and my maid be suffered to come near him.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000599">She,</span> 
    <span id="f000600">who at Mitylene had so carefully concealed her birth,</span> 
    <span id="f000601">ashamed to tell that one of royal ancestry was now a slave,</span> 
    <span id="f000602">first began to speak to Pericles of the wayward changes in her own fate,</span> 
    <span id="f000603">telling him from what a high estate herself had fallen.</span> 
    <span id="f000604">As if she had known it was her royal father she stood before,</span> 
    <span id="f000605">all the words she spoke were of her own sorrows;</span> 
    <span id="f000606">but her reason for so doing was,</span> 
    <span id="f000607">that she knew nothing more wins the attention of the unfortunate than the recital of some sad calamity to match their own.</span> 
    <span id="f000608">The sound of her sweet voice aroused the drooping prince;</span> 
    <span id="f000609">he lifted up his eyes,</span> 
    <span id="f000610">which had been so long fixed and motionless;</span> 
    <span id="f000611">and Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000612">who was the perfect image of her mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000613">presented to his amazed sight the features of his dead queen.</span> 
    <span id="f000614">The long-silent prince was once more heard to speak.</span> 
    <span id="f000615">«My dearest wife,» said the awakened Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000616">«was like this maid,</span> 
    <span id="f000617">and such a one might my daughter have been.</span> 
    <span id="f000618">My queen’s square brows,</span> 
    <span id="f000619">her stature to an inch,</span> 
    <span id="f000620">as wand-like straight,</span> 
    <span id="f000621">as silver-voiced,</span> 
    <span id="f000622">her eyes as jewel-like.</span> 
    <span id="f000623">Where do you live,</span> 
    <span id="f000624">young maid?</span> 
    <span id="f000625">Report your parentage.</span> 
    <span id="f000626">I think you said you had been tossed from wrong to injury,</span> 
    <span id="f000627">and that you thought your griefs would equal mine,</span> 
    <span id="f000628">if both were opened.» «Some such thing I said,» replied Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000629">«and said no more than what my thoughts did warrant me as likely.» «Tell me your story,» answered Pericles;</span> 
    <span id="f000630">«if I find you have known the thousandth part of my endurance,</span> 
    <span id="f000631">you have borne your sorrows like a man,</span> 
    <span id="f000632">and I have suffered like a girl;</span> 
    <span id="f000633">yet you do look like Patience gazing on kings’ graves,</span> 
    <span id="f000634">and smiling extremity out of act.</span> 
    <span id="f000635">How lost you your name,</span> 
    <span id="f000636">my most kind virgin?</span> 
    <span id="f000637">Recount your story I beseech you.</span> 
    <span id="f000638">Come,</span> 
    <span id="f000639">sit by me.» How was Pericles surprised when she said her name was Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000640">for he knew it was no usual name,</span> 
    <span id="f000641">but had been invented by himself for his own child to signify seaborn:</span> 
    <span id="f000642">«O,</span> 
    <span id="f000643">I am mocked,» said he,</span> 
    <span id="f000644">«and you are sent hither by some incensed god to make the world laugh at me.» «Patience,</span> 
    <span id="f000645">good sir,» said Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000646">«or I must cease here.» «Nay,» said Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000647">«I will be patient;</span> 
    <span id="f000648">you little know how you do startle me,</span> 
    <span id="f000649">to call yourself Marina.» «The name,» she replied,</span> 
    <span id="f000650">«was given me by one that had some power,</span> 
    <span id="f000651">my father,</span> 
    <span id="f000652">and a king.» «How,</span> 
    <span id="f000653">a king’s daughter!» said Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000654">«and called Marina!</span> 
    <span id="f000655">But are you flesh and blood?</span> 
    <span id="f000656">Are you no fairy?</span> 
    <span id="f000657">Speak on;</span> 
    <span id="f000658">where were you born?</span> 
    <span id="f000659">and wherefore called Marina?» She replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000660">«I was called Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000661">because I was born at sea.</span> 
    <span id="f000662">My mother was the daughter of a king;</span> 
    <span id="f000663">she died the minute I was born,</span> 
    <span id="f000664">as my good nurse Lychorida has often told me weeping.</span> 
    <span id="f000665">The king,</span> 
    <span id="f000666">my father,</span> 
    <span id="f000667">left me at Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000668">till the cruel wife of Cleon sought to murder me.</span> 
    <span id="f000669">A crew of pirates came and rescued me,</span> 
    <span id="f000670">and brought me here to Mitylene.</span> 
    <span id="f000671">But,</span> 
    <span id="f000672">good sir,</span> 
    <span id="f000673">why do you weep?</span> 
    <span id="f000674">It may be,</span> 
    <span id="f000675">you think me an impostor.</span> 
    <span id="f000676">But,</span> 
    <span id="f000677">indeed,</span> 
    <span id="f000678">sir,</span> 
    <span id="f000679">I am the daughter to king Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000680">if good king Pericles be living.» Then Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000681">terrified as he seemed at his own sudden joy,</span> 
    <span id="f000682">and doubtful if this could be real,</span> 
    <span id="f000683">loudly called for his attendants,</span> 
    <span id="f000684">who rejoiced at the sound of their beloved king’s voice;</span> 
    <span id="f000685">and he said to Helicanus:</span> 
    <span id="f000686">«O Helicanus,</span> 
    <span id="f000687">strike me,</span> 
    <span id="f000688">give me a gash,</span> 
    <span id="f000689">put me to present pain,</span> 
    <span id="f000690">lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me,</span> 
    <span id="f000691">overbear the shores of my mortality.</span> 
    <span id="f000692">O,</span> 
    <span id="f000693">come hither,</span> 
    <span id="f000694">thou that west born at sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000695">buried at Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000696">and found at sea again.</span> 
    <span id="f000697">O Helicanus,</span> 
    <span id="f000698">down on your knees,</span> 
    <span id="f000699">thank the holy gods!</span> 
    <span id="f000700">This is Marina.</span> 
    <span id="f000701">Now blessings on thee,</span> 
    <span id="f000702">my child!</span> 
    <span id="f000703">Give me fresh garments,</span> 
    <span id="f000704">mine own Helicanus!</span> 
    <span id="f000705">She is not dead at Tarsus as she should have been by the savage Dionysia.</span> 
    <span id="f000706">She shall tell you all,</span> 
    <span id="f000707">when you shall kneel to her and call her your very princess.</span> 
    <span id="f000708">Who is this?» (observing Lysimachus for the first time).</span> 
    <span id="f000709">«Sir,» said Helicanus,</span> 
    <span id="f000710">«it is the governor of Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000711">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000712">hearing of your melancholy,</span> 
    <span id="f000713">came to see you.» «I embrace you,</span> 
    <span id="f000714">sir,» said Pericles.</span> 
    <span id="f000715">«Give me my robes!</span> 
    <span id="f000716">I am wild with beholding — O heaven bless my girl!</span> 
    <span id="f000717">But hark,</span> 
    <span id="f000718">what music is that?» — for now,</span> 
    <span id="f000719">either sent by some kind god,</span> 
    <span id="f000720">or by his own delighted fancy deceived,</span> 
    <span id="f000721">he seemed to hear soft music.</span> 
    <span id="f000722">«My lord,</span> 
    <span id="f000723">I hear none,» replied Helicanus.</span> 
    <span id="f000724">«None?» said Pericles;</span> 
    <span id="f000725">«why it is the music of the spheres.» As there was no music to be heard,</span> 
    <span id="f000726">Lysimachus concluded that the sudden joy had unsettled the prince’s understanding;</span> 
    <span id="f000727">and he said:</span> 
    <span id="f000728">«It is not good to cross him:</span> 
    <span id="f000729">let him have his way»:</span> 
    <span id="f000730">and then they told him they heard the music;</span> 
    <span id="f000731">and he now complaining of a drowsy slumber coming over him,</span> 
    <span id="f000732">Lysimachus persuaded him to rest on a couch,</span> 
    <span id="f000733">and placing a pillow under his head,</span> 
    <span id="f000734">he,</span> 
    <span id="f000735">quite overpowered with excess of joy,</span> 
    <span id="f000736">sank into a sound sleep,</span> 
    <span id="f000737">and Marina watched in silence by the couch of her sleeping parent.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000738">While he slept,</span> 
    <span id="f000739">Pericles dreamed a dream which made him resolve to go to Ephesus.</span> 
    <span id="f000740">His dream was,</span> 
    <span id="f000741">that Diana,</span> 
    <span id="f000742">the goddess of the Ephesians,</span> 
    <span id="f000743">appeared to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000744">and commanded him to go to her temple at Ephesus,</span> 
    <span id="f000745">and there before her altar to declare the story of his life and misfortunes;</span> 
    <span id="f000746">and by her silver bow she swore,</span> 
    <span id="f000747">that if he performed her injunction,</span> 
    <span id="f000748">he should meet with some rate felicity.</span> 
    <span id="f000749">When he awoke,</span> 
    <span id="f000750">being miraculously refreshed,</span> 
    <span id="f000751">he told his dream,</span> 
    <span id="f000752">and that his resolution was to obey the bidding of the goddess.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000753">Then Lysimachus invited Pericles to come on shore,</span> 
    <span id="f000754">and refresh himself with such entertainment as he should find at Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000755">which courteous offer Pericles accepting,</span> 
    <span id="f000756">agreed to tarry with him for the space of a day or two.</span> 
    <span id="f000757">During which time we may well suppose what feastings,</span> 
    <span id="f000758">what rejoicings,</span> 
    <span id="f000759">what costly shows and entertainments the governor made in Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000760">to greet the royal father of his dear Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000761">whom in her obscure fortunes he had so respected.</span> 
    <span id="f000762">Nor did Pericles frown upon Lysimachus’s suit,</span> 
    <span id="f000763">when he understood how he had honoured his child in the days of her low estate,</span> 
    <span id="f000764">and that Marina showed herself not averse to his proposals;</span> 
    <span id="f000765">only he made it a condition,</span> 
    <span id="f000766">before he gave his consent,</span> 
    <span id="f000767">that they should visit with him the shrine of the Ephesian Diana:</span> 
    <span id="f000768">to whose temple they shortly after all three undertook a voyage;</span> 
    <span id="f000769">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000770">the goddess herself filling their sails with prosperous winds,</span> 
    <span id="f000771">after a few weeks they arrived in safety at Ephesus.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000772">There was standing near the altar of the goddess,</span> 
    <span id="f000773">when Pericles with his train entered the temple,</span> 
    <span id="f000774">the good Cerimon (now grown very aged) who had restored Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000775">the wife of Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000776">to life;</span> 
    <span id="f000777">and Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000778">now a priestess of the temple,</span> 
    <span id="f000779">was standing before the altar;</span> 
    <span id="f000780">and though the many years he had passed in sorrow for her loss had much altered Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000781">Thaisa thought she knew her husband’s features,</span> 
    <span id="f000782">and when he approached the altar and began to speak,</span> 
    <span id="f000783">she remembered his voice,</span> 
    <span id="f000784">and listened to his words with wonder and a joyful amazement.</span> 
    <span id="f000785">And these were the words that Pericles spoke before the altar:</span> 
    <span id="f000786">«Hail,</span> 
    <span id="f000787">Diana!</span> 
    <span id="f000788">to perform thy just commands,</span> 
    <span id="f000789">I here confess myself the prince of Tyre,</span> 
    <span id="f000790">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000791">frighted from my country,</span> 
    <span id="f000792">at Pentapolis wedded the fair Thaisa:</span> 
    <span id="f000793">she died at sea in childbed,</span> 
    <span id="f000794">but brought forth a maid-child called Marina.</span> 
    <span id="f000795">She at Tarsus was nursed with Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000796">who at fourteen years thought to kill her,</span> 
    <span id="f000797">but her better stars brought her to Mitylene,</span> 
    <span id="f000798">by whose shores as I sailed,</span> 
    <span id="f000799">her good fortunes brought this maid on board,</span> 
    <span id="f000800">where by her most clear remembrance she made herself known to be my daughter.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000801">Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000802">unable to bear the transports which his words had raised in her,</span> 
    <span id="f000803">cried out:</span> 
    <span id="f000804">«You are,</span> 
    <span id="f000805">you are,</span> 
    <span id="f000806">O royal Pericles» — and fainted.</span> 
    <span id="f000807">«What means this woman?» said Pericles:</span> 
    <span id="f000808">«she dies!</span> 
    <span id="f000809">gentlemen,</span> 
    <span id="f000810">help.» — «Sir,» said Cerimon,</span> 
    <span id="f000811">«if you have told Diana’s altar true,</span> 
    <span id="f000812">this is your wife.» «Reverend gentleman,</span> 
    <span id="f000813">no,» said Pericles:</span> 
    <span id="f000814">«I threw her overboard with these very arms.» Cerimon then recounted how,</span> 
    <span id="f000815">early one tempestuous morning,</span> 
    <span id="f000816">this lady was thrown upon the Ephesian shore;</span> 
    <span id="f000817">how,</span> 
    <span id="f000818">opening the coffin,</span> 
    <span id="f000819">he found therein rich jewels,</span> 
    <span id="f000820">and a paper;</span> 
    <span id="f000821">how,</span> 
    <span id="f000822">happily,</span> 
    <span id="f000823">he recovered her,</span> 
    <span id="f000824">and placed her here in Diana’s temple.</span> 
    <span id="f000825">And now,</span> 
    <span id="f000826">Thaisa being restored from her swoon said:</span> 
    <span id="f000827">«O my lord,</span> 
    <span id="f000828">are you not Pericles?</span> 
    <span id="f000829">Like him you speak,</span> 
    <span id="f000830">like him you are.</span> 
    <span id="f000831">Did you not name a tempest,</span> 
    <span id="f000832">a birth,</span> 
    <span id="f000833">and death?» He astonished said:</span> 
    <span id="f000834">«The voice of dead Thaisa!» «That Thaisa am I,» she replied,</span> 
    <span id="f000835">«supposed dead and drowned.» «O true Diana!» exclaimed Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000836">in a passion of devout astonishment.</span> 
    <span id="f000837">«And now,» said Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000838">«I know you better.</span> 
    <span id="f000839">Such a ring as I see on your finger did the king my father give you,</span> 
    <span id="f000840">when we with tears parted from him at Pentapolis.» «Enough,</span> 
    <span id="f000841">you gods!» cried Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000842">«your present kindness makes my past miseries sport.</span> 
    <span id="f000843">O come,</span> 
    <span id="f000844">Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000845">be buried a second time within these arms.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000846">And Marina said:</span> 
    <span id="f000847">«My heart leaps to be gone into my mother’s bosom.» Then did Pericles show his daughter to her mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000848">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000849">«Look who kneels here,</span> 
    <span id="f000850">flesh of thy flesh,</span> 
    <span id="f000851">thy burthen at sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000852">and called Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000853">because she was yielded there.» «Blessed and my own!» said Thaisa:</span> 
    <span id="f000854">and while she hung in rapturous joy over her child,</span> 
    <span id="f000855">Pericles knelt before the altar,</span> 
    <span id="f000856">saying:</span> 
    <span id="f000857">«Pure Diana,</span> 
    <span id="f000858">bless thee for thy vision.</span> 
    <span id="f000859">For this,</span> 
    <span id="f000860">I will offer oblations nightly to thee.» And then and there did Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000861">with the consent of Thaisa,</span> 
    <span id="f000862">solemnly affiance their daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000863">the virtuous Marina,</span> 
    <span id="f000864">to the well-deserving Lysimachus in marriage.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000865">Thus have we seen in Pericles,</span> 
    <span id="f000866">his queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000867">and daughter,</span> 
    <span id="f000868">a famous example of virtue assailed by calamity (through the sufferance of Heaven,</span> 
    <span id="f000869">to teach patience and constancy to men),</span> 
    <span id="f000870">under the same guidance becoming finally successful,</span> 
    <span id="f000871">and triumphing over chance and change.</span> 
    <span id="f000872">In Helicanus we have beheld a notable pattern of truth,</span> 
    <span id="f000873">of faith,</span> 
    <span id="f000874">and loyalty,</span> 
    <span id="f000875">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000876">when he might have succeeded to a shone,</span> 
    <span id="f000877">chose rather to recall the rightful owner to his possession,</span> 
    <span id="f000878">than to become great by another’s wrong.</span> 
    <span id="f000879">In the worthy Cerimon,</span> 
    <span id="f000880">who restored Thaisa to life,</span> 
    <span id="f000881">we are instructed how goodness directed by knowledge,</span> 
    <span id="f000882">in bestowing benefits upon mankind,</span> 
    <span id="f000883">approaches to the nature of the gods.</span> 
    <span id="f000884">It only remains to be told,</span> 
    <span id="f000885">that Dionysia,</span> 
    <span id="f000886">the wicked wife of Cleon,</span> 
    <span id="f000887">met with an end proportionable to her deserts;</span> 
    <span id="f000888">the inhabitants of Tarsus,</span> 
    <span id="f000889">when her cruel attempt upon Marina was known,</span> 
    <span id="f000890">rising in a body to revenge the daughter of their benefactor,</span> 
    <span id="f000891">and setting fire to the palace of Cleon,</span> 
    <span id="f000892">burnt both him and her,</span> 
    <span id="f000893">and their whole household:</span> 
    <span id="f000894">the gods seeming well pleased,</span> 
    <span id="f000895">that so foul a murder,</span> 
    <span id="f000896">though but intentional,</span> 
    <span id="f000897">and never carried into act,</span> 
    <span id="f000898">should be punished in a way befitting its enormity.</span></p>
