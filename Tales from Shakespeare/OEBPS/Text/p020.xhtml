   <h1 class="chapterTitle"><span id="f000001">Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</span></h1> 
   <p><span id="f000002">Gertrude,</span> 
    <span id="f000003">queen of Denmark,</span> 
    <span id="f000004">becoming a widow by the sudden death of King Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000005">in less than two months after his death married his brother Claudius,</span> 
    <span id="f000006">which was noted by all people at the time for a strange act of indiscretion,</span> 
    <span id="f000007">or unfeelingness,</span> 
    <span id="f000008">or worse:</span> 
    <span id="f000009">for this Claudius did no ways resemble her late husband in the qualities of his person or his mind,</span> 
    <span id="f000010">but was as contemptible in outward appearance,</span> 
    <span id="f000011">as he was base and unworthy in disposition;</span> 
    <span id="f000012">and suspicions did not fail to arise in the minds of some,</span> 
    <span id="f000013">that he had privately made away with his brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000014">the late king,</span> 
    <span id="f000015">with the view of marrying his widow,</span> 
    <span id="f000016">and ascending the throne of Denmark,</span> 
    <span id="f000017">to the exclusion of young Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000018">the son of the buried king,</span> 
    <span id="f000019">and lawful successor to the throne.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000020">But upon no one did this unadvised action of the queen make such impression as upon this young prince,</span> 
    <span id="f000021">who loved and venerated the memory of his dead father almost to idolatry,</span> 
    <span id="f000022">and being of a nice sense of honour,</span> 
    <span id="f000023">and a most exquisite practicer of propriety himself,</span> 
    <span id="f000024">did sorely take to heart this unworthy conduct of his mother Gertrude:</span> 
    <span id="f000025">insomuch that,</span> 
    <span id="f000026">between grief for his father’s death and shame for his mother’s marriage,</span> 
    <span id="f000027">this young prince was overclouded with a deep melancholy,</span> 
    <span id="f000028">and lost all his mirth and all his good looks;</span> 
    <span id="f000029">all his customary pleasure in books forsook him,</span> 
    <span id="f000030">his princely exercises and sports,</span> 
    <span id="f000031">proper to his youth,</span> 
    <span id="f000032">were no longer acceptable;</span> 
    <span id="f000033">he grew weary of the world,</span> 
    <span id="f000034">which seemed to him an unweeded garden,</span> 
    <span id="f000035">where all the wholesome flowers were choked up,</span> 
    <span id="f000036">and nothing but weeds could thrive.</span> 
    <span id="f000037">Not that the prospect of exclusion from the throne,</span> 
    <span id="f000038">his lawful inheritance,</span> 
    <span id="f000039">weighed so much upon his spirits,</span> 
    <span id="f000040">though that to a young and high-minded prince was a bitter wound and a sore indignity;</span> 
    <span id="f000041">but what so galled him,</span> 
    <span id="f000042">and took away all his cheerful spirits,</span> 
    <span id="f000043">was,</span> 
    <span id="f000044">that his mother had shown herself so forgetful to his father’s memory;</span> 
    <span id="f000045">and such a father!</span> 
    <span id="f000046">who had been to her so loving and so gentle a husband!</span> 
    <span id="f000047">and then she always appeared as loving and obedient a wife to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000048">and would hang upon him as if her affection grew to him:</span> 
    <span id="f000049">and now within two months,</span> 
    <span id="f000050">or as it seemed to young Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000051">less than two months,</span> 
    <span id="f000052">she had married again,</span> 
    <span id="f000053">married his uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000054">her dear husband’s brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000055">in itself a highly improper and unlawful marriage,</span> 
    <span id="f000056">from the nearness of relationship,</span> 
    <span id="f000057">but made much more so by the indecent haste with which it was concluded,</span> 
    <span id="f000058">and the unkingly character of the man whom she had chosen to be the partner of her throne and bed.</span> 
    <span id="f000059">This it was,</span> 
    <span id="f000060">which more than the loss of ten kingdoms,</span> 
    <span id="f000061">dashed the spirits and brought a cloud over the mind of this honourable young prince.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000062">In vain was all that his mother Gertrude or the king could do to contrive to divert him;</span> 
    <span id="f000063">he still appeared in court in a suit of deep black,</span> 
    <span id="f000064">as mourning for the king his father’s death,</span> 
    <span id="f000065">which mode of dress he had never laid aside,</span> 
    <span id="f000066">not even in compliment to his mother upon the day she was married,</span> 
    <span id="f000067">nor could he be brought to join in any of the festivities or rejoicings of that (as appeared to him) disgraceful day.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000068">What mostly troubled him was an uncertainty about the manner of his father’s death.</span> 
    <span id="f000069">It was given out by Claudius that a serpent had stung him;</span> 
    <span id="f000070">but young Hamlet had shrewd suspicions that Claudius himself was the serpent;</span> 
    <span id="f000071">in plain English,</span> 
    <span id="f000072">that he had murdered him for his crown,</span> 
    <span id="f000073">and that the serpent who stung his father did now sit on the throne.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000074">How far he was right in this conjecture,</span> 
    <span id="f000075">and what he ought to think of his mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000076">how far she was privy to this murder,</span> 
    <span id="f000077">and whether by her consent or knowledge,</span> 
    <span id="f000078">or without,</span> 
    <span id="f000079">it came to pass,</span> 
    <span id="f000080">were the doubts which continually harassed and distracted him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000081">A rumour had reached the ear of young Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000082">that an apparition,</span> 
    <span id="f000083">exactly resembling the dead king his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000084">had been seen by the soldiers upon watch,</span> 
    <span id="f000085">on the platform before the palace at midnight,</span> 
    <span id="f000086">for two or three nights successively.</span> 
    <span id="f000087">The figure came constantly clad in the same suit of armour,</span> 
    <span id="f000088">from head to foot,</span> 
    <span id="f000089">which the dead king was known to have worn:</span> 
    <span id="f000090">and they who saw it (Hamlet’s bosom friend Horatio was one) agreed in their testimony as to the time and manner of its appearance:</span> 
    <span id="f000091">that it came just as the clock struck twelve;</span> 
    <span id="f000092">that it looked pale,</span> 
    <span id="f000093">with a face more of sorrow than of anger;</span> 
    <span id="f000094">that its beard was grisly,</span> 
    <span id="f000095">and the colour a sable silvered,</span> 
    <span id="f000096">as they had seen it in his lifetime:</span> 
    <span id="f000097">that it made no answer when they spoke to it;</span> 
    <span id="f000098">yet once they thought it lifted up its head,</span> 
    <span id="f000099">and addressed itself to motion,</span> 
    <span id="f000100">as if it were about to speak;</span> 
    <span id="f000101">but in that moment the morning cock crew,</span> 
    <span id="f000102">and it shrunk in haste away,</span> 
    <span id="f000103">and vanished out of their sight.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000104">The young prince,</span> 
    <span id="f000105">strangely amazed at their relation,</span> 
    <span id="f000106">which was too consistent and agreeing with itself to disbelieve,</span> 
    <span id="f000107">concluded that it was his father’s ghost which they had seen,</span> 
    <span id="f000108">and determined to take his watch with the soldiers that night,</span> 
    <span id="f000109">that he might have a chance of seeing it;</span> 
    <span id="f000110">for he reasoned with himself,</span> 
    <span id="f000111">that such an appearance did not come for nothing,</span> 
    <span id="f000112">but that the ghost had something to impart,</span> 
    <span id="f000113">and though it had been silent hitherto,</span> 
    <span id="f000114">yet it would speak to him.</span> 
    <span id="f000115">And he waited with impatience for the coming of night.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000116">When night came he took his stand with Horatio,</span> 
    <span id="f000117">and Marcellus,</span> 
    <span id="f000118">one of the guard,</span> 
    <span id="f000119">upon the platform,</span> 
    <span id="f000120">where this apparition was accustomed to walk:</span> 
    <span id="f000121">and it being a cold night,</span> 
    <span id="f000122">and the air unusually raw and nipping,</span> 
    <span id="f000123">Hamlet and Horatio and their companion fell into some talk about the coldness of the night,</span> 
    <span id="f000124">which was suddenly broken off by Horatio announcing that the ghost was coming.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000125">At the sight of his father’s spirit,</span> 
    <span id="f000126">Hamlet was struck with a sudden surprise and fear.</span> 
    <span id="f000127">He at first called upon the angels and heavenly ministers to defend them.</span> 
    <span id="f000128">for he knew not whether it were a good spirit or bad;</span> 
    <span id="f000129">whether it came for good or evil:</span> 
    <span id="f000130">but he gradually assumed more courage;</span> 
    <span id="f000131">and his father (as it seemed to him) looked upon him so piteously,</span> 
    <span id="f000132">and as it were desiring to have conversation with him,</span> 
    <span id="f000133">and did in all respects appear so like himself as he was when he lived,</span> 
    <span id="f000134">that Hamlet could not help addressing him:</span> 
    <span id="f000135">he called him by his name,</span> 
    <span id="f000136">Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000137">King,</span> 
    <span id="f000138">Father!</span> 
    <span id="f000139">and conjured him that he would tell the reason why he had left his grave,</span> 
    <span id="f000140">where they had seen him quietly bestowed,</span> 
    <span id="f000141">to come again and visit the earth and the moonlight:</span> 
    <span id="f000142">and besought him that he would let them know if there was anything which they could do to give peace to his spirit.</span> 
    <span id="f000143">And the ghost beckoned to Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000144">that he should go with him to some more removed place,</span> 
    <span id="f000145">where they might be alone;</span> 
    <span id="f000146">and Horatio and Marcellus would have dissuaded the young prince from following it,</span> 
    <span id="f000147">for they feared lest it should be some evil spirit,</span> 
    <span id="f000148">who would tempt him to the neighbouring sea,</span> 
    <span id="f000149">or to the top of some dreadful cliff,</span> 
    <span id="f000150">and there put on some horrible shape which might deprive the prince of his reason.</span> 
    <span id="f000151">But their counsels and entreaties could not alter Hamlet’s determination,</span> 
    <span id="f000152">who cared too little about life to fear the losing of it;</span> 
    <span id="f000153">and as to his soul,</span> 
    <span id="f000154">he said,</span> 
    <span id="f000155">what could the spirit do to that,</span> 
    <span id="f000156">being a thing immortal as itself?</span> 
    <span id="f000157">And he felt as hardy as a lion,</span> 
    <span id="f000158">and bursting from them,</span> 
    <span id="f000159">who did all they could to hold him,</span> 
    <span id="f000160">he followed whithersoever the spirit led him.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000161">And when they were alone together,</span> 
    <span id="f000162">the spirit broke silence,</span> 
    <span id="f000163">and told him that he was the ghost of Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000164">his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000165">who had been cruelly murdered,</span> 
    <span id="f000166">and he told the manner of it;</span> 
    <span id="f000167">that it was done by his own brother Claudius,</span> 
    <span id="f000168">Hamlet’s uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000169">as Hamlet had already but too much suspected,</span> 
    <span id="f000170">for the hope of succeeding to his bed and crown.</span> 
    <span id="f000171">That as he was sleeping in his garden,</span> 
    <span id="f000172">his custom always in the afternoon,</span> 
    <span id="f000173">his treasonous brother stole upon him in his sleep,</span> 
    <span id="f000174">and poured the juice of poisonous henbane into his ears,</span> 
    <span id="f000175">which has such an antipathy to the life of man,</span> 
    <span id="f000176">that swift as quicksilver it courses through all the veins of the body,</span> 
    <span id="f000177">baking up the blood,</span> 
    <span id="f000178">and spreading a crustlike leprosy all over the skin:</span> 
    <span id="f000179">thus sleeping,</span> 
    <span id="f000180">by a brother’s hand he was cut off at once from his crown,</span> 
    <span id="f000181">his queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000182">and his life:</span> 
    <span id="f000183">and he adjured Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000184">if he did ever his dear father love that he would revenge his foul murder.</span> 
    <span id="f000185">And the ghost lamented to his son,</span> 
    <span id="f000186">that his mother should so fall off from virtue,</span> 
    <span id="f000187">as to prove false to the wedded love of her first husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000188">and to marry his murderer,</span> 
    <span id="f000189">but he cautioned Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000190">howsoever he proceeded in his revenge against his wicked uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000191">by no means to act any violence against the person of his mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000192">but to leave her to heaven,</span> 
    <span id="f000193">and to the stings and thorns of conscience.</span> 
    <span id="f000194">And Hamlet promised to observe the ghost’s direction in all things,</span> 
    <span id="f000195">and the ghost vanished.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000196">And when Hamlet was left alone,</span> 
    <span id="f000197">he took up a solemn resolution,</span> 
    <span id="f000198">that all he had in his memory,</span> 
    <span id="f000199">all that he had ever learned by books or observation,</span> 
    <span id="f000200">should be instantly forgotten by him,</span> 
    <span id="f000201">and nothing live in his brain but the memory of what the ghost had told him,</span> 
    <span id="f000202">and enjoined him to do.</span> 
    <span id="f000203">And Hamlet related the particulars of the conversation which had passed to none but his dear friend Horatio;</span> 
    <span id="f000204">and he enjoined both to him and Marcellus the strictest secrecy as to what they had seen that night.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000205">The terror which the sight of the ghost had left upon the senses of Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000206">he being weak and dispirited before,</span> 
    <span id="f000207">almost unhinged his mind,</span> 
    <span id="f000208">and drove him beside his reason.</span> 
    <span id="f000209">And he,</span> 
    <span id="f000210">fearing that it would continue to have this effect,</span> 
    <span id="f000211">which might subject him to observation,</span> 
    <span id="f000212">and set his uncle upon his guard,</span> 
    <span id="f000213">if he suspected that he was meditating anything against him,</span> 
    <span id="f000214">or that Hamlet really knew more of his father’s death than he professed,</span> 
    <span id="f000215">took up a strange resolution,</span> 
    <span id="f000216">from that time to counterfeit as if he were really and truly mad;</span> 
    <span id="f000217">thinking that he would be less an object of suspicion when his uncle should believe him incapable of any serious project,</span> 
    <span id="f000218">and that his real perturbation of mind would be best covered and pass concealed under a disguise of pretended lunacy.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000219">From this time Hamlet affected a certain wildness and strangeness in his apparel,</span> 
    <span id="f000220">his speech,</span> 
    <span id="f000221">and behaviour,</span> 
    <span id="f000222">and did so excellently conterfeit the madman,</span> 
    <span id="f000223">that the king and queen were both deceived,</span> 
    <span id="f000224">and not thinking his grief for his father’s death a sufficient cause to produce such a distemper,</span> 
    <span id="f000225">for they knew not of the appearance of the ghost,</span> 
    <span id="f000226">they concluded that his malady was love,</span> 
    <span id="f000227">and they thought they had found out the object.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000228">Before Hamlet fell into the melancholy way which has been related,</span> 
    <span id="f000229">he had dearly loved a fair maid called Ophelia,</span> 
    <span id="f000230">the daughter of Polonius,</span> 
    <span id="f000231">the king’s chief counsellor in affairs of state.</span> 
    <span id="f000232">He had sent her letters and rings,</span> 
    <span id="f000233">and made many tenders of his affection to her,</span> 
    <span id="f000234">and importuned her with love in honourable fashion:</span> 
    <span id="f000235">and she had given belief to his vows and importunities.</span> 
    <span id="f000236">But the melancholy which he fell into latterly had made him neglect her,</span> 
    <span id="f000237">and from the time he conceived the project of counterfeiting madness,</span> 
    <span id="f000238">he affected to treat her with unkindness,</span> 
    <span id="f000239">and a sort of rudeness:</span> 
    <span id="f000240">but she good lady,</span> 
    <span id="f000241">rather than reproach him with being false to her,</span> 
    <span id="f000242">persuaded herself that it was nothing but the disease in his mind,</span> 
    <span id="f000243">and no settled unkindness,</span> 
    <span id="f000244">which had made him less observant of her than formerly;</span> 
    <span id="f000245">and she compared the faculties of his once noble mind and excellent understanding,</span> 
    <span id="f000246">impaired as they were with the deep melancholy that oppressed him,</span> 
    <span id="f000247">to sweet bells which in themselves are capable of most exquisite music,</span> 
    <span id="f000248">but when jangled out of tune,</span> 
    <span id="f000249">or rudely handled,</span> 
    <span id="f000250">produce only a harsh and unpleasing sound.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000251">Though the rough business which Hamlet had in hand,</span> 
    <span id="f000252">the revenging of his father’s death upon his murderer,</span> 
    <span id="f000253">did not suit with the playful state of courtship,</span> 
    <span id="f000254">or admit of the society of so idle a passion as love now seemed to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000255">yet it could not hinder but that soft thoughts of his Ophelia would come between,</span> 
    <span id="f000256">and in one of these moments,</span> 
    <span id="f000257">when he thought that his treatment of this gentle lady had been unreasonably harsh,</span> 
    <span id="f000258">he wrote her a letter full of wild starts of passion,</span> 
    <span id="f000259">and in extravagant terms,</span> 
    <span id="f000260">such as agreed with his supposed madness,</span> 
    <span id="f000261">but mixed with some gentle touches of affection,</span> 
    <span id="f000262">which could not but show to this honoured lady that a deep love for her yet lay at the bottom of his heart.</span> 
    <span id="f000263">He bade her to doubt the stars were fire,</span> 
    <span id="f000264">and to doubt that the sun did move,</span> 
    <span id="f000265">to doubt truth to be a liar,</span> 
    <span id="f000266">but never to doubt that he loved;</span> 
    <span id="f000267">with more of such extravagant phrases.</span> 
    <span id="f000268">This letter Ophelia dutifully showed to her father,</span> 
    <span id="f000269">and the old man thought himself bound to communicate it to the king and queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000270">who from that time supposed that the true cause of Hamlet’s madness was love.</span> 
    <span id="f000271">And the queen wished that the good beauties of Ophelia might be the happy cause of his wildness,</span> 
    <span id="f000272">for so she hoped that her virtues might happily restore him to his accustomed way again,</span> 
    <span id="f000273">to both their honours.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000274">But Hamlet’s malady lay deeper than she supposed,</span> 
    <span id="f000275">or than could be so cured.</span> 
    <span id="f000276">His father’s ghost,</span> 
    <span id="f000277">which he had seen,</span> 
    <span id="f000278">still haunted his imagination,</span> 
    <span id="f000279">and the sacred injunction to revenge his murder gave him no rest till it was accomplished.</span> 
    <span id="f000280">Every hour of delay seemed to him a sin,</span> 
    <span id="f000281">and a violation of his father’s commands.</span> 
    <span id="f000282">Yet how to compass the death of the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000283">surrounded as he constantly was with his guards,</span> 
    <span id="f000284">was no easy matter.</span> 
    <span id="f000285">Or if it had been,</span> 
    <span id="f000286">the presence of the queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000287">Hamlet’s mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000288">who was generally with the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000289">was a restraint upon his purpose,</span> 
    <span id="f000290">which he could not break through.</span> 
    <span id="f000291">Besides,</span> 
    <span id="f000292">the very circumstance that the usurper was his mother’s husband filled him with some remorse,</span> 
    <span id="f000293">and still blunted the edge of his purpose.</span> 
    <span id="f000294">The mere act of putting a fellow-creature to death was in itself odious and terrible to a disposition naturally so gentle as Hamlet’s was.</span> 
    <span id="f000295">His very melancholy,</span> 
    <span id="f000296">and the dejection of spirits he had so long been in,</span> 
    <span id="f000297">produced an irresoluteness and wavering of purpose which kept him from proceeding to extremities.</span> 
    <span id="f000298">Moreover,</span> 
    <span id="f000299">he could not help having some scruples upon his mind,</span> 
    <span id="f000300">whether the spirit which he had seen was indeed his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000301">or whether it might not be the devil,</span> 
    <span id="f000302">who he had heard has power to take any form he pleases,</span> 
    <span id="f000303">and who might have assumed his father’s shape only to take advantage of his weakness and his melancholy,</span> 
    <span id="f000304">to drive him to the doing of so desperate an act as murder.</span> 
    <span id="f000305">And he determined that he would have more certain grounds to go upon than a vision,</span> 
    <span id="f000306">or apparition,</span> 
    <span id="f000307">which might be a deluston.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000308">While he was in this irresolute mind there came to the court certain players,</span> 
    <span id="f000309">in whom Hamlet formerly used to take delight,</span> 
    <span id="f000310">and particularly to hear one of them speak a tragical speech,</span> 
    <span id="f000311">describing the death of old Priam,</span> 
    <span id="f000312">King of Troy,</span> 
    <span id="f000313">with the grief of Hecuba his queen.</span> 
    <span id="f000314">Hamlet welcomed his old friends,</span> 
    <span id="f000315">the players,</span> 
    <span id="f000316">and remembering how that speech had formerly given him pleasure,</span> 
    <span id="f000317">requested the player to repeat it;</span> 
    <span id="f000318">which he did in so lively a manner,</span> 
    <span id="f000319">setting forth the cruel murder of the feeble old king,</span> 
    <span id="f000320">with the destruction of his people and city by fire,</span> 
    <span id="f000321">and the mad grief of the old queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000322">running barefoot up and down the palace,</span> 
    <span id="f000323">with a poor clout upon that head where a crown had been,</span> 
    <span id="f000324">and with nothing but a blanket upon her loins,</span> 
    <span id="f000325">snatched up in haste,</span> 
    <span id="f000326">where she had worn a royal robe;</span> 
    <span id="f000327">that not only it drew tears from all that stood by,</span> 
    <span id="f000328">who thought they saw the real scene,</span> 
    <span id="f000329">so lively was it represented,</span> 
    <span id="f000330">but even the player himself delivered it with a broken voice and real tears.</span> 
    <span id="f000331">This put Hamlet upon thinking,</span> 
    <span id="f000332">if that player could so work himself up to passion by a mere fictitious speech,</span> 
    <span id="f000333">to weep for one that he had never seen,</span> 
    <span id="f000334">for Hecuba,</span> 
    <span id="f000335">that had been dead so many hundred years,</span> 
    <span id="f000336">how dull was he,</span> 
    <span id="f000337">who having a read motive and cue for passion,</span> 
    <span id="f000338">a real king and a dear father murdered,</span> 
    <span id="f000339">was yet so little moved,</span> 
    <span id="f000340">that his revenge all this while had seemed to have slept in dull and muddy forgetfulness!</span> 
    <span id="f000341">and while he meditated on actors and acting,</span> 
    <span id="f000342">and the powerful effects which a good play,</span> 
    <span id="f000343">represented to the life,</span> 
    <span id="f000344">has upon the spectator,</span> 
    <span id="f000345">he remembered the instance of some murderer,</span> 
    <span id="f000346">who seeing a murder on the stage,</span> 
    <span id="f000347">was by the mere force of the scene and resemblance of circumstances so affected,</span> 
    <span id="f000348">that on the spot he confessed the crime which he had committed.</span> 
    <span id="f000349">And he determined that these players should play something like the murder of his father before his uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000350">and he would watch narrowly what effect it might have upon him,</span> 
    <span id="f000351">and from his looks he would be able to gather with more certainty if he were the murderer or not.</span> 
    <span id="f000352">To this effect he ordered a play to be prepared,</span> 
    <span id="f000353">to the representation of which he invited the king and queen.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000354">The story of the play was of a murder done in Vienna upon a duke.</span> 
    <span id="f000355">The duke’s name was Gonzago,</span> 
    <span id="f000356">his wife Baptista.</span> 
    <span id="f000357">The play showed how one Lucianus,</span> 
    <span id="f000358">a near relation to the duke,</span> 
    <span id="f000359">poisoned him in his garden for his estate,</span> 
    <span id="f000360">and how the murderer in a short time after got the love of Gonzago’s wife.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000361">At the representation of this play,</span> 
    <span id="f000362">the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000363">who did not know the trap which was laid for him,</span> 
    <span id="f000364">was present,</span> 
    <span id="f000365">with his queen and the whole court:</span> 
    <span id="f000366">Hamlet sitting attentively near him to observe his looks.</span> 
    <span id="f000367">The play began with a conversation between Gonzago and his wife,</span> 
    <span id="f000368">in which the lady made many protestations of love,</span> 
    <span id="f000369">and of never marrying a second husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000370">if she should outlive Gonzago;</span> 
    <span id="f000371">wishing she might be accursed if she ever took a second husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000372">and adding that no woman did so,</span> 
    <span id="f000373">but those wicked women who kill their first husbands.</span> 
    <span id="f000374">Hamlet observed the king his uncle change colour at this expression,</span> 
    <span id="f000375">and that it was as bad as wormwood both to him and to the queen.</span> 
    <span id="f000376">But when Lucianus,</span> 
    <span id="f000377">according to the story,</span> 
    <span id="f000378">came to poison Gonzago sleeping in the garden,</span> 
    <span id="f000379">the strong resemblance which it bore to his own wicked act upon the late king,</span> 
    <span id="f000380">his brother,</span> 
    <span id="f000381">whom he had poisoned in his garden,</span> 
    <span id="f000382">so struck upon the conscience of this usurper,</span> 
    <span id="f000383">that he was unable to sit out the rest of the play,</span> 
    <span id="f000384">but on a sudden calling for lights to his chamber,</span> 
    <span id="f000385">and affecting or partly feeling a sudden sickness,</span> 
    <span id="f000386">he abruptly left the theatre.</span> 
    <span id="f000387">The king being departed,</span> 
    <span id="f000388">the play was given over.</span> 
    <span id="f000389">Now Hamlet had seen enough to be satisfied that the words of the ghost were true,</span> 
    <span id="f000390">and no illusion;</span> 
    <span id="f000391">and in a fit of gaiety,</span> 
    <span id="f000392">like that which comes over a man who suddenly has some great doubt or scruple resolved,</span> 
    <span id="f000393">he swore to Horatio,</span> 
    <span id="f000394">that he would take the ghost’s word for a thousand pounds.</span> 
    <span id="f000395">But before he could make up his resolution as to what measures of revenge he should take,</span> 
    <span id="f000396">now he was certainly informed that his uncle was his father’s murderer,</span> 
    <span id="f000397">he was sent for by the queen his mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000398">to a private conference in her closet.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000399">It was by desire of the king that the queen sent for Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000400">that she might signify to her son how much his late behaviour had displeased them both,</span> 
    <span id="f000401">and the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000402">wishing to know all that passed at that conference,</span> 
    <span id="f000403">and thinking that the too partial report of a mother might let slip some part of Hamlet’s words,</span> 
    <span id="f000404">which it might much import the king to know,</span> 
    <span id="f000405">Polonius,</span> 
    <span id="f000406">the old counsellor of state,</span> 
    <span id="f000407">was ordered to plant himself behind the hangings in the queen’s closet,</span> 
    <span id="f000408">where he might unseen hear all that passed.</span> 
    <span id="f000409">This artifice was particularly adapted to the disposition of Polonius,</span> 
    <span id="f000410">who was a man grown old in crooked maxims and policies of state,</span> 
    <span id="f000411">and delighted to get at the knowledge of matters in an indirect and cunning way.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000412">Hamlet being come to his mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000413">she began to tax him in the roundest way with his actions and behaviour,</span> 
    <span id="f000414">and she told him that he had given great offence to his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000415">meaning the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000416">his uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000417">whom,</span> 
    <span id="f000418">because he had married her,</span> 
    <span id="f000419">she called Hamlet’s father.</span> 
    <span id="f000420">Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000421">sorely indignant that she should give so dear and honoured a name as father seemed to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000422">to a wretch who was indeed no better than the murderer of his true father,</span> 
    <span id="f000423">with some sharpness replied:</span> 
    <span id="f000424">«Mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000425">you have much offended my father.» The queen said that was but an idle answer.</span> 
    <span id="f000426">«As good as the question deserved,» said Hamlet.</span> 
    <span id="f000427">The queen asked him if he had forgotten who it was he was speaking to?</span> 
    <span id="f000428">«Alas!» replied Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000429">«I wish I could forget.</span> 
    <span id="f000430">You are the queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000431">your husband’s brother’s wife;</span> 
    <span id="f000432">and you are my mother:</span> 
    <span id="f000433">I wish you were not what you are.» «Nay,</span> 
    <span id="f000434">then,» said the queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000435">«if you show me so little respect,</span> 
    <span id="f000436">I will set those to you that can speak,» and was going to send the king or Polonius to him.</span> 
    <span id="f000437">But Hamlet would not let her go,</span> 
    <span id="f000438">now he had her alone,</span> 
    <span id="f000439">till he had tried if his words could not bring her to some sense of her wicked life;</span> 
    <span id="f000440">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000441">taking her by the wrist,</span> 
    <span id="f000442">he held her fast,</span> 
    <span id="f000443">and made her sit down.</span> 
    <span id="f000444">She,</span> 
    <span id="f000445">affrighted at his earnest manner,</span> 
    <span id="f000446">and fearful lest in his lunacy he should do her a mischief,</span> 
    <span id="f000447">cried out;</span> 
    <span id="f000448">and a voice was heard from behind the hangings:</span> 
    <span id="f000449">«Help,</span> 
    <span id="f000450">help,</span> 
    <span id="f000451">the queen!» which Hamlet hearing,</span> 
    <span id="f000452">and verily thinking that it was the king himself there concealed,</span> 
    <span id="f000453">he drew his sword and stabbed at the place where the voice came from,</span> 
    <span id="f000454">as he would have stabbed a rat that ran there,</span> 
    <span id="f000455">till the voice ceasing,</span> 
    <span id="f000456">he concluded the person to be dead.</span> 
    <span id="f000457">But when he dragged for the body,</span> 
    <span id="f000458">it was not the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000459">but Polonius,</span> 
    <span id="f000460">the old officious counsellor,</span> 
    <span id="f000461">that had planted himself as a spy behind the hangings.</span> 
    <span id="f000462">«Oh me!» exclaimed the queen,</span> 
    <span id="f000463">«what a rash and bloody deed have you done!» «A bloody deed,</span> 
    <span id="f000464">mother,» replied Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000465">«but not so bad as yours,</span> 
    <span id="f000466">who killed a king,</span> 
    <span id="f000467">and married his brother.» Hamlet had gone too far to leave off here.</span> 
    <span id="f000468">He was now in the humour to speak plainly to his mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000469">and he pursued it.</span> 
    <span id="f000470">And though the faults of parents are to be tenderly treated by their children,</span> 
    <span id="f000471">yet in the case of great crimes the son may have leave to speak even to his own mother with some harshness,</span> 
    <span id="f000472">so as that harshness is meant for her good,</span> 
    <span id="f000473">and to turn her from her wicked ways,</span> 
    <span id="f000474">and not done for the purpose of upbraiding.</span> 
    <span id="f000475">And now this virtuous prince did in moving terms represent to the queen the heinousness of her offence,</span> 
    <span id="f000476">in being so forgetful of the dead king,</span> 
    <span id="f000477">his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000478">as in so short a space of time to marry with his brother and reputed murderer:</span> 
    <span id="f000479">such an act as,</span> 
    <span id="f000480">after the vows which she had sworn to her first husband was enough to make all vows of women suspected,</span> 
    <span id="f000481">and all virtue to be accounted hypocrisy,</span> 
    <span id="f000482">wedding contracts to be less than gamesters’ oaths,</span> 
    <span id="f000483">and religion to be a mockery and a mere form of words.</span> 
    <span id="f000484">He said she had done such a deed,</span> 
    <span id="f000485">that the heavens blushed at it,</span> 
    <span id="f000486">and the earth was sick of her because of it.</span> 
    <span id="f000487">And he showed her two pictures,</span> 
    <span id="f000488">the one of the late king,</span> 
    <span id="f000489">her first husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000490">and the other of the present king,</span> 
    <span id="f000491">her second husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000492">and he bade her mark the difference;</span> 
    <span id="f000493">what a grace was on the brow of his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000494">how like a god he looked!</span> 
    <span id="f000495">the curls of Apollo,</span> 
    <span id="f000496">the forehead of Jupiter,</span> 
    <span id="f000497">the eye of Mars,</span> 
    <span id="f000498">and a posture like to Mercury newly alighted on some heaven-kissing hill!</span> 
    <span id="f000499">this man,</span> 
    <span id="f000500">he said,</span> 
    <span id="f000501">had been her husband.</span> 
    <span id="f000502">And then he showed her whom she had got in his stead:</span> 
    <span id="f000503">how like a blight or a mildew he looked,</span> 
    <span id="f000504">for so he had blasted his wholesome brother.</span> 
    <span id="f000505">And the queen was sore ashamed that he should so turn her eyes inward upon her soul,</span> 
    <span id="f000506">which she now saw so black and deformed.</span> 
    <span id="f000507">And he asked her how she could continue to live with this man,</span> 
    <span id="f000508">and be a wife to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000509">who had murdered her first husband,</span> 
    <span id="f000510">and got the crown by as false means as a thief — and just as he spoke,</span> 
    <span id="f000511">the ghost of his father,</span> 
    <span id="f000512">such as he was in his lifetime,</span> 
    <span id="f000513">and such as he had lately seen it,</span> 
    <span id="f000514">entered the room,</span> 
    <span id="f000515">and Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000516">in great terror,</span> 
    <span id="f000517">asked what it would have;</span> 
    <span id="f000518">and the ghost said that it came to remind him of the revenge he had promised,</span> 
    <span id="f000519">which Hamlet seemed to have forgot;</span> 
    <span id="f000520">and the ghost bade him speak to his mother,</span> 
    <span id="f000521">for the grief and terror she was in would else kill her.</span> 
    <span id="f000522">It then vanished,</span> 
    <span id="f000523">and was seen by none but Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000524">neither could he by pointing to where it stood,</span> 
    <span id="f000525">or by any description,</span> 
    <span id="f000526">make his mother perceive it;</span> 
    <span id="f000527">who was terribly frightened all this while to hear him conversing,</span> 
    <span id="f000528">as it seemed to her,</span> 
    <span id="f000529">with nothing;</span> 
    <span id="f000530">and she imputed it to the disorder of his mind.</span> 
    <span id="f000531">But Hamlet begged her not to flatter her wicked soul in such a manner as to think that it was his madness,</span> 
    <span id="f000532">and not her own offences,</span> 
    <span id="f000533">which had brought his father’s spirit again on the earth.</span> 
    <span id="f000534">And he bade her feel his pulse,</span> 
    <span id="f000535">how temperately it beat,</span> 
    <span id="f000536">not like a madman’s.</span> 
    <span id="f000537">And he begged of her with tears,</span> 
    <span id="f000538">to confess herself to heaven for what was past,</span> 
    <span id="f000539">and for the future to avoid the company of the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000540">and be no more as a wife to him:</span> 
    <span id="f000541">and when she should show herself a mother to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000542">by respecting his father’s memory,</span> 
    <span id="f000543">he would ask a blessing of her as a son.</span> 
    <span id="f000544">And she promising to observe his directions,</span> 
    <span id="f000545">the conference ended.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000546">And now Hamlet was at leisure to consider who it was that in his unfortunate rashness he had killed:</span> 
    <span id="f000547">and when he came to see that it was Polonius,</span> 
    <span id="f000548">the father of the lady Ophelia,</span> 
    <span id="f000549">whom he so dearly loved,</span> 
    <span id="f000550">he drew apart the dead body,</span> 
    <span id="f000551">and,</span> 
    <span id="f000552">his spirits being now a little quieter,</span> 
    <span id="f000553">he wept for what he had done.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000554">The unfortunate death of Polonius gave the king a pretence for sending Hamlet out of the kingdom.</span> 
    <span id="f000555">He would willingly have put him to death,</span> 
    <span id="f000556">fearing him as dangerous;</span> 
    <span id="f000557">but he dreaded the people,</span> 
    <span id="f000558">who loved Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000559">and the queen who,</span> 
    <span id="f000560">with all her faults,</span> 
    <span id="f000561">doted upon the prince,</span> 
    <span id="f000562">her son.</span> 
    <span id="f000563">So this subtle king,</span> 
    <span id="f000564">under presence of providing for Hamlet’s safety,</span> 
    <span id="f000565">that he might not be called to account for Polonius’ death,</span> 
    <span id="f000566">caused him to be conveyed on board a ship bound for England,</span> 
    <span id="f000567">under the care of two courtiers,</span> 
    <span id="f000568">by whom he despatched letters to the English court,</span> 
    <span id="f000569">which in that time was in subjection and paid tribute to Denmark,</span> 
    <span id="f000570">requiring for special reasons there pretended,</span> 
    <span id="f000571">that Hamlet should be put to death as soon as he landed on English ground.</span> 
    <span id="f000572">Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000573">suspecting some treachery,</span> 
    <span id="f000574">in the night-time secretly got at the letters,</span> 
    <span id="f000575">and skilfully erasing his own name,</span> 
    <span id="f000576">he in the stead of it put in the names of those two courtiers,</span> 
    <span id="f000577">who had the charge of him,</span> 
    <span id="f000578">to be put to death:</span> 
    <span id="f000579">then sealing up the letters,</span> 
    <span id="f000580">he put them into their place again.</span> 
    <span id="f000581">Soon after the ship was attacked by pirates,</span> 
    <span id="f000582">and a sea-fight commenced;</span> 
    <span id="f000583">in the course of which Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000584">desirous to show his valour,</span> 
    <span id="f000585">with sword in hand singly boarded the enemy’s vessel;</span> 
    <span id="f000586">while his own ship,</span> 
    <span id="f000587">in a cowardly manner,</span> 
    <span id="f000588">bore away,</span> 
    <span id="f000589">and leaving him to his fate,</span> 
    <span id="f000590">the two courtiers made the best of their way to England,</span> 
    <span id="f000591">charged with those letters the sense of which Hamlet had altered to their own deserved destruction.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000592">The pirates,</span> 
    <span id="f000593">who had the prince in their power,</span> 
    <span id="f000594">showed themselves gentle enemies;</span> 
    <span id="f000595">and knowing whom they had got prisoner,</span> 
    <span id="f000596">in the hope that the prince might do them a good turn at court in recompense for any favour they might show him,</span> 
    <span id="f000597">they set Hamlet on shore at the nearest port in Denmark.</span> 
    <span id="f000598">From that place Hamlet wrote to the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000599">acquainting him with the strange chance which had brought him back to his own country,</span> 
    <span id="f000600">and saying that on the next day he should present himself before his majesty.</span> 
    <span id="f000601">When he got home,</span> 
    <span id="f000602">a sad spectacle offered itself the first thing to his eyes.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000603">This was the funeral of the young and beautiful Ophelia,</span> 
    <span id="f000604">his once dear mistress.</span> 
    <span id="f000605">The wits of this young lady had begun to turn ever since her poor father’s death.</span> 
    <span id="f000606">That he should die a violent death,</span> 
    <span id="f000607">and by the hands of the prince whom she loved,</span> 
    <span id="f000608">so affected this tender young maid,</span> 
    <span id="f000609">that in a little time she grew perfectly distracted,</span> 
    <span id="f000610">and would go about giving flowers away to the ladies of the court,</span> 
    <span id="f000611">and saying that they were for her father’s burial,</span> 
    <span id="f000612">singing songs about love and about death,</span> 
    <span id="f000613">and sometimes such as had no meaning at all,</span> 
    <span id="f000614">as if she had no memory of what happened to her.</span> 
    <span id="f000615">There was a willow which grew slanting over a brook,</span> 
    <span id="f000616">and reflected its leaves on the stream.</span> 
    <span id="f000617">To this brook she came one day when she was unwatched,</span> 
    <span id="f000618">with garlands she had been making,</span> 
    <span id="f000619">mixed up of daisies and nettles,</span> 
    <span id="f000620">flowers and weeds together,</span> 
    <span id="f000621">and clambering up to hang her garland upon the boughs of the willow,</span> 
    <span id="f000622">a bough broke,</span> 
    <span id="f000623">and precipitated this fair young maid,</span> 
    <span id="f000624">garland,</span> 
    <span id="f000625">and all that she had gathered,</span> 
    <span id="f000626">into the water,</span> 
    <span id="f000627">where her clothes bore her up for a while,</span> 
    <span id="f000628">during which she chanted scraps of old tunes,</span> 
    <span id="f000629">like one insensible to her own distress,</span> 
    <span id="f000630">or as if she were a creature natural to that element:</span> 
    <span id="f000631">but long it was not before her garments,</span> 
    <span id="f000632">heavy with the wet,</span> 
    <span id="f000633">pulled her in from her melodious singing to a muddy and miserable death.</span> 
    <span id="f000634">It was the funeral of this fair maid which her brother Laertes was celebrating,</span> 
    <span id="f000635">the king and queen and whole court being present,</span> 
    <span id="f000636">when Hamlet arrived.</span> 
    <span id="f000637">He knew not what all this show imported,</span> 
    <span id="f000638">but stood on one side,</span> 
    <span id="f000639">not inclining to interrupt the ceremony.</span> 
    <span id="f000640">He saw the flowers strewed upon her grave,</span> 
    <span id="f000641">as the custom was in maiden burials,</span> 
    <span id="f000642">which the queen herself threw in;</span> 
    <span id="f000643">and as she threw them she said:</span> 
    <span id="f000644">«Sweets to the sweet!</span> 
    <span id="f000645">I thought to have decked thy bride-bed,</span> 
    <span id="f000646">sweet maid,</span> 
    <span id="f000647">not to have strewed thy grave.</span> 
    <span id="f000648">Thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife.» And he heard her brother wish that violets might spring from her grave:</span> 
    <span id="f000649">and he saw him leap into the grave all frantic with grief,</span> 
    <span id="f000650">and bid the attendants pile mountains of earth upon him,</span> 
    <span id="f000651">that he might be buried with her.</span> 
    <span id="f000652">And Hamlet’s love for this fair maid came back to him,</span> 
    <span id="f000653">and he could not bear that a brother should show so much transport of grief,</span> 
    <span id="f000654">for he thought that he loved Ophelia better than forty thousand brothers.</span> 
    <span id="f000655">Then discovering himself,</span> 
    <span id="f000656">he leaped into the grave where Laertes was,</span> 
    <span id="f000657">all as frantic or more frantic than he,</span> 
    <span id="f000658">and Laertes knowing him to be Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000659">who had been the cause of his father’s and his sister’s death,</span> 
    <span id="f000660">grappled him by the throat as an enemy,</span> 
    <span id="f000661">till the attendants parted them:</span> 
    <span id="f000662">and Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000663">after the funeral,</span> 
    <span id="f000664">excused his hasty act in throwing himself into the grave as if to brave Laertes;</span> 
    <span id="f000665">but he said he could not bear that any one should seem to outgo him in grief for the death of the fair Ophelia.</span> 
    <span id="f000666">And for the time these two noble youths seemed reconciled.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000667">But out of the grief and anger of Laertes for the death of his father and Ophelia,</span> 
    <span id="f000668">the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000669">Hamlet’s wicked uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000670">contrived destruction for Hamlet.</span> 
    <span id="f000671">He set on Laertes,</span> 
    <span id="f000672">under cover of peace and reconciliation,</span> 
    <span id="f000673">to challenge Hamlet to a friendly trial of skill at fencing,</span> 
    <span id="f000674">which Hamlet accepting,</span> 
    <span id="f000675">a day was appointed to try the match.</span> 
    <span id="f000676">At this match all the court was present,</span> 
    <span id="f000677">and Laertes,</span> 
    <span id="f000678">by direction of the king,</span> 
    <span id="f000679">prepared a poisoned weapon.</span> 
    <span id="f000680">Upon this match great wagers were laid by the courtiers,</span> 
    <span id="f000681">as both Hamlet and Laertes were known to excel at this sword play;</span> 
    <span id="f000682">and Hamlet taking up the foils chose one,</span> 
    <span id="f000683">not at all suspecting the treachery of Laertes,</span> 
    <span id="f000684">or being careful to examine Laertes’ weapon,</span> 
    <span id="f000685">who,</span> 
    <span id="f000686">instead of a foil or blunted sword,</span> 
    <span id="f000687">which the laws of fencing require,</span> 
    <span id="f000688">made use of one with a point,</span> 
    <span id="f000689">and poisoned.</span> 
    <span id="f000690">At first Laertes did but play with Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000691">and suffered him to gain some advantages,</span> 
    <span id="f000692">which the dissembling king magnified and extolled beyond measure,</span> 
    <span id="f000693">drinking to Hamlet’s success,</span> 
    <span id="f000694">and wagering rich bets upon the issue:</span> 
    <span id="f000695">but after a few passes,</span> 
    <span id="f000696">Laertes growing warm made a deadly thrust at Hamlet with his poisoned weapon,</span> 
    <span id="f000697">and gave him a mortal blow.</span> 
    <span id="f000698">Hamlet incensed,</span> 
    <span id="f000699">but not knowing the whole of the treachery,</span> 
    <span id="f000700">in the scuffle exchanged his own innocent weapon for Laertes’ deadly one,</span> 
    <span id="f000701">and with a thrust of Laertes’ own sword repaid Laertes home,</span> 
    <span id="f000702">who was thus justly caught in his own treachery.</span> 
    <span id="f000703">In this instant the queen shrieked out that she was poisoned.</span> 
    <span id="f000704">She had inadvertently drunk out of a bowl which the king had prepared for Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000705">in case,</span> 
    <span id="f000706">that being warm in fencing,</span> 
    <span id="f000707">he should call for drink:</span> 
    <span id="f000708">into this the treacherous king had infused a deadly poison,</span> 
    <span id="f000709">to make sure of Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000710">if Laertes had failed.</span> 
    <span id="f000711">He had forgotten to warn the queen of the bowl.</span> 
    <span id="f000712">which she drank of,</span> 
    <span id="f000713">and immediately died,</span> 
    <span id="f000714">exclaiming with her last breath that she was poisoned.</span> 
    <span id="f000715">Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000716">suspecting some treachery,</span> 
    <span id="f000717">ordered the doors to be shut,</span> 
    <span id="f000718">while he sought it out.</span> 
    <span id="f000719">Laertes told him to seek no farther for he was the traitor,</span> 
    <span id="f000720">and feeling his life go away with the wound which Hamlet had given him,</span> 
    <span id="f000721">he made confession of the treachery he had used,</span> 
    <span id="f000722">and now he had fallen a victim to it:</span> 
    <span id="f000723">and he told Hamlet of the envenomed point,</span> 
    <span id="f000724">and said that Hamlet had not half an hour to live,</span> 
    <span id="f000725">for no medicine could cure him;</span> 
    <span id="f000726">and begging forgiveness of Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000727">he died,</span> 
    <span id="f000728">with his last words accusing the king of being the contriver of the mischief.</span> 
    <span id="f000729">When Hamlet saw his end draw near,</span> 
    <span id="f000730">there being yet some venom left upon the sword,</span> 
    <span id="f000731">he suddenly turned upon his false uncle,</span> 
    <span id="f000732">and thrust the point of it to his heart,</span> 
    <span id="f000733">fulfilling the promise which he had made to his father’s spirit,</span> 
    <span id="f000734">whose injunction was now accomplished,</span> 
    <span id="f000735">and his foul murder revenged upon the murderer.</span> 
    <span id="f000736">Then Hamlet,</span> 
    <span id="f000737">feeling his breath fail and life departing,</span> 
    <span id="f000738">turned to his dear friend Horatio,</span> 
    <span id="f000739">who had been spectator of this fatal tragedy;</span> 
    <span id="f000740">and with his dying breath requested him that he would live to tell his story to the world (for Horatio had made a motion as if he would slay himself to accompany the prince in death),</span> 
    <span id="f000741">and Horatio promised that he would make a true report,</span> 
    <span id="f000742">as one that was privy to all the circumstances.</span> 
    <span id="f000743">And,</span> 
    <span id="f000744">thus satisfied,</span> 
    <span id="f000745">the noble heart of Hamlet cracked;</span> 
    <span id="f000746">and Horatio and the bystanders with many tears commended the spirit of this sweet prince to the guardianship of angels.</span> 
    <span id="f000747">For Hamlet was a loving and a gentle prince,</span> 
    <span id="f000748">and greatly beloved for his many noble and princelike qualities;</span> 
    <span id="f000749">and if he had lived,</span> 
    <span id="f000750">would no doubt have proved a most royal and complete king to Denmark.</span></p>
