   <p><span id="f000002">The first clerk in the telegraph booth in the Baltimore Station whistled through his buck teeth at the second clerk:</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000003">«S’matter?»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000004">«See that girl –</span> 
    <span id="f000005">no,</span> 
    <span id="f000006">the pretty one with the big black dots on her veil.</span> 
    <span id="f000007">Too late –</span> 
    <span id="f000008">she’s gone.</span> 
    <span id="f000009">You missed somep’n.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000010">«What about her?»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000011">«Nothing.</span> 
    <span id="f000012">’Cept she’s damn good-looking.</span> 
    <span id="f000013">Came in here yesterday and sent a wire to some guy to meet her somewhere.</span> 
    <span id="f000014">Then a minute ago she came in with a telegram all written out and was standin’ there goin’ to give it to me when she changed her mind or somep’n and all of a sudden tore it up.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000015">«Hm.»</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000016">The first clerk came around tile counter and picking up the two pieces of paper from the floor put them together idly.</span> 
    <span id="f000017">The second clerk read them over his shoulder and subconsciously counted the words as he read.</span> 
    <span id="f000018">There were just thirteen.</span></p> 
   <blockquote class="letter">
   <p><span id="f000019">This is in the way of a permanent goodbye.</span> 
    <span id="f000020">I should suggest Italy.</span></p> 
   <p class="signature"><span id="f000021">Lois</span></p> 
   </blockquote>
   <p><span id="f000022">«Tore it up,</span> 
    <span id="f000023">eh?» said the second clerk.</span></p>
