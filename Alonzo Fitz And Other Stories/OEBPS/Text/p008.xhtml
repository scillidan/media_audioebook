   <hr class="separator" />
   <p><span id="f000002">The nervous,</span>
   <span id="f000003">dapper,</span>
   <span id="f000004">“peart” young man took the chair I offered him,</span>
   <span id="f000005">and said he was connected with the Daily Thunderstorm,</span>
   <span id="f000006">and added:</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000007">“Hoping it’s no harm,</span>
   <span id="f000008">I’ve come to interview you.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000009">“Come to what?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000010">“Interview you.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000011">“Ah!</span>
   <span id="f000012">I see.</span>
   <span id="f000013">Yes – yes.</span>
   <span id="f000014">Um!</span>
   <span id="f000015">Yes – yes.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000016">I was not feeling bright that morning.</span>
   <span id="f000017">Indeed,</span>
   <span id="f000018">my powers seemed a bit under a cloud.</span>
   <span id="f000019">However,</span>
   <span id="f000020">I went to the bookcase,</span>
   <span id="f000021">and when I had been looking six or seven minutes I found I was obliged to refer to the young man.</span>
   <span id="f000022">I said:</span>
   <span id="f000023">–</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000024">“How do you spell it?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000025">“Spell what?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000026">“Interview.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000027">“Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000028">my goodness!</span>
   <span id="f000029">what do you want to spell it for?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000030">“I don’t want to spell it;</span>
   <span id="f000031">I want to see what it means.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000032">“Well,</span>
   <span id="f000033">this is astonishing,</span>
   <span id="f000034">I must say.</span>
   <span id="f000035">I can tell you what it means,</span>
   <span id="f000036">if you – if you – ”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000037">“Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000038">all right!</span>
   <span id="f000039">That will answer,</span>
   <span id="f000040">and much obliged to you,</span>
   <span id="f000041">too.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000042">“In,</span>
   <span id="f000043">in,</span>
   <span id="f000044">ter,</span>
   <span id="f000045">ter,</span>
   <span id="f000046">inter – ”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000047">“Then you spell it with an I?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000048">“Why certainly!”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000049">“Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000050">that is what took me so long.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000051">“Why,</span>
   <span id="f000052">my dear sir,</span>
   <span id="f000053">what did you propose to spell it with?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000054">“Well,</span>
   <span id="f000055">I – I – hardly know.</span>
   <span id="f000056">I had the Unabridged,</span>
   <span id="f000057">and I was ciphering around in the back end,</span>
   <span id="f000058">hoping I might tree her among the pictures.</span>
   <span id="f000059">But it’s a very old edition.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000060">“Why,</span>
   <span id="f000061">my friend,</span>
   <span id="f000062">they wouldn’t have a picture of it in even the latest e – My dear sir,</span>
   <span id="f000063">I beg your pardon,</span>
   <span id="f000064">I mean no harm in the world,</span>
   <span id="f000065">but you do not look as – as – intelligent as I had expected you would.</span>
   <span id="f000066">No harm – I mean no harm at all.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000067">“Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000068">don’t mention it!</span>
   <span id="f000069">It has often been said,</span>
   <span id="f000070">and by people who would not flatter and who could have no inducement to flatter,</span>
   <span id="f000071">that I am quite remarkable in that way.</span>
   <span id="f000072">Yes – yes;</span>
   <span id="f000073">they always speak of it with rapture.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000074">“I can easily imagine it.</span>
   <span id="f000075">But about this interview.</span>
   <span id="f000076">You know it is the custom,</span>
   <span id="f000077">now,</span>
   <span id="f000078">to interview any man who has become notorious.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000079">“Indeed,</span>
   <span id="f000080">I had not heard of it before.</span>
   <span id="f000081">It must be very interesting.</span>
   <span id="f000082">What do you do it with?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000083">“Ah,</span>
   <span id="f000084">well – well – well – this is disheartening.</span>
   <span id="f000085">It ought to be done with a club in some cases;</span>
   <span id="f000086">but customarily it consists in the interviewer asking questions and the interviewed answering them.</span>
   <span id="f000087">It is all the rage now.</span>
   <span id="f000088">Will you let me ask you certain questions calculated to bring out the salient points of your public and private history?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000089">“Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000090">with pleasure – with pleasure.</span>
   <span id="f000091">I have a very bad memory,</span>
   <span id="f000092">but I hope you will not mind that.</span>
   <span id="f000093">That is to say,</span>
   <span id="f000094">it is an irregular memory – singularly irregular.</span>
   <span id="f000095">Sometimes it goes in a gallop,</span>
   <span id="f000096">and then again it will be as much as a fortnight passing a given point.</span>
   <span id="f000097">This is a great grief to me.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000098">“Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000099">it is no matter,</span>
   <span id="f000100">so you will try to do the best you can.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000101">“I will.</span>
   <span id="f000102">I will put my whole mind on it.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000103">“Thanks.</span>
   <span id="f000104">Are you ready to begin?”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000105">“Ready.”</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000106">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000107">How old are you?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000108">A.</span>
   <span id="f000109">Nineteen,</span>
   <span id="f000110">in June.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000111">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000112">Indeed.</span>
   <span id="f000113">I would have taken you to be thirty-five or six.</span>
   <span id="f000114">Where were you born?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000115">A.</span>
   <span id="f000116">In Missouri.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000117">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000118">When did you begin to write?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000119">A.</span>
   <span id="f000120">In 1836.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000121">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000122">Why,</span>
   <span id="f000123">how could that be,</span>
   <span id="f000124">if you are only nineteen now?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000125">A.</span>
   <span id="f000126">I don’t know.</span>
   <span id="f000127">It does seem curious,</span>
   <span id="f000128">somehow.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000129">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000130">It does,</span>
   <span id="f000131">indeed.</span>
   <span id="f000132">Whom do you consider the most remarkable man you ever met?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000133">A.</span>
   <span id="f000134">Aaron Burr.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000135">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000136">But you never could have met Aaron Burr,</span>
   <span id="f000137">if you are only nineteen years!</span>
   <span id="f000138">–</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000139">A.</span>
   <span id="f000140">Now,</span>
   <span id="f000141">if you know more about me than I do,</span>
   <span id="f000142">what do you ask me for?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000143">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000144">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000145">it was only a suggestion;</span>
   <span id="f000146">nothing more.</span>
   <span id="f000147">How did you happen to meet Burr?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000148">A.</span>
   <span id="f000149">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000150">I happened to be at his funeral one day,</span>
   <span id="f000151">and he asked me to make less noise,</span>
   <span id="f000152">and –</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000153">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000154">But,</span>
   <span id="f000155">good heavens!</span>
   <span id="f000156">if you were at his funeral,</span>
   <span id="f000157">he must have been dead,</span>
   <span id="f000158">and if he was dead how could he care whether you made a noise or not?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000159">A.</span>
   <span id="f000160">I don’t know.</span>
   <span id="f000161">He was always a particular kind of a man that way.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000162">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000163">Still,</span>
   <span id="f000164">I don’t understand it at all.</span>
   <span id="f000165">You say he spoke to you,</span>
   <span id="f000166">and that he was dead.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000167">A.</span>
   <span id="f000168">I didn’t say he was dead.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000169">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000170">But wasn’t he dead?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000171">A.</span>
   <span id="f000172">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000173">some said he was,</span>
   <span id="f000174">some said he wasn’t.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000175">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000176">What did you think?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000177">A.</span>
   <span id="f000178">Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000179">it was none of my business!</span>
   <span id="f000180">It wasn’t any of my funeral.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000181">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000182">Did you – However,</span>
   <span id="f000183">we can never get this matter straight.</span>
   <span id="f000184">Let me ask about something else.</span>
   <span id="f000185">What was the date of your birth?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000186">A.</span>
   <span id="f000187">Monday,</span>
   <span id="f000188">October 31,</span>
   <span id="f000189">1693.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000190">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000191">What!</span>
   <span id="f000192">Impossible!</span>
   <span id="f000193">That would make you a hundred and eighty years old.</span>
   <span id="f000194">How do you account for that?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000195">A.</span>
   <span id="f000196">I don’t account for it at all.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000197">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000198">But you said at first you were only nineteen,</span>
   <span id="f000199">and now you make yourself out to be one hundred and eighty.</span>
   <span id="f000200">It is an awful discrepancy.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000201">A.</span>
   <span id="f000202">Why,</span>
   <span id="f000203">have you noticed that?</span>
   <span id="f000204">(Shaking hands.)</span>
   <span id="f000205">Many a time it has seemed to me like a discrepancy,</span>
   <span id="f000206">but somehow I couldn’t make up my mind.</span>
   <span id="f000207">How quick you notice a thing!</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000208">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000209">Thank you for the compliment,</span>
   <span id="f000210">as far as it goes.</span>
   <span id="f000211">Had you,</span>
   <span id="f000212">or have you,</span>
   <span id="f000213">any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000214">A.</span>
   <span id="f000215">Eh!</span>
   <span id="f000216">I – I – I think so – yes – but I don’t remember.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000217">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000218">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000219">that is the most extraordinary statement I ever heard!</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000220">A.</span>
   <span id="f000221">Why,</span>
   <span id="f000222">what makes you think that?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000223">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000224">How could I think otherwise?</span>
   <span id="f000225">Why,</span>
   <span id="f000226">look here!</span>
   <span id="f000227">Who is this a picture of on the wall?</span>
   <span id="f000228">Isn’t that a brother of yours?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000229">A.</span>
   <span id="f000230">Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000231">yes,</span>
   <span id="f000232">yes,</span>
   <span id="f000233">yes!</span>
   <span id="f000234">Now you remind me of it;</span>
   <span id="f000235">that was a brother of mine.</span>
   <span id="f000236">That’s William – Bill we called him.</span>
   <span id="f000237">Poor old Bill!</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000238">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000239">Why?</span>
   <span id="f000240">Is he dead,</span>
   <span id="f000241">then?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000242">A.</span>
   <span id="f000243">Ah!</span>
   <span id="f000244">well,</span>
   <span id="f000245">I suppose so.</span>
   <span id="f000246">We never could tell.</span>
   <span id="f000247">There was a great mystery about it.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000248">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000249">That is sad,</span>
   <span id="f000250">very sad.</span>
   <span id="f000251">He disappeared,</span>
   <span id="f000252">then?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000253">A.</span>
   <span id="f000254">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000255">yes,</span>
   <span id="f000256">in a sort of general way.</span>
   <span id="f000257">We buried him –</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000258">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000259">Buried him!</span>
   <span id="f000260">Buried him,</span>
   <span id="f000261">without knowing whether he was dead or not?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000262">A.</span>
   <span id="f000263">Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000264">no!</span>
   <span id="f000265">Not that.</span>
   <span id="f000266">He was dead enough.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000267">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000268">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000269">I confess that I can’t understand this.</span>
   <span id="f000270">If you buried him,</span>
   <span id="f000271">and you knew he was dead.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000272">A.</span>
   <span id="f000273">No!</span>
   <span id="f000274">no!</span>
   <span id="f000275">We only thought he was.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000276">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000277">Oh,</span>
   <span id="f000278">I see!</span>
   <span id="f000279">He came to life again?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000280">A.</span>
   <span id="f000281">I bet he didn’t.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000282">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000283">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000284">I never heard anything like this.</span>
   <span id="f000285">Somebody was dead.</span>
   <span id="f000286">Somebody was buried.</span>
   <span id="f000287">Now,</span>
   <span id="f000288">where was the mystery?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000289">A.</span>
   <span id="f000290">Ah!</span>
   <span id="f000291">that’s just it!</span>
   <span id="f000292">That’s it exactly.</span>
   <span id="f000293">You see,</span>
   <span id="f000294">we were twins – defunct and I – and we got mixed in the bathtub when we were only two weeks old,</span>
   <span id="f000295">and one of us was drowned.</span>
   <span id="f000296">But we didn’t know which.</span>
   <span id="f000297">Some think it was Bill.</span>
   <span id="f000298">Some think it was me.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000299">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000300">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000301">that is remarkable.</span>
   <span id="f000302">What do you think?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000303">A.</span>
   <span id="f000304">Goodness knows!</span>
   <span id="f000305">I would give whole worlds to know.</span>
   <span id="f000306">This solemn,</span>
   <span id="f000307">this awful mystery has cast a gloom over my whole life.</span>
   <span id="f000308">But I will tell you a secret now,</span>
   <span id="f000309">which I never have revealed to any creature before.</span>
   <span id="f000310">One of us had a peculiar mark – a large mole on the back of his left hand;</span>
   <span id="f000311">that was me.</span>
   <span id="f000312">That child was the one that was drowned!</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000313">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000314">Very well,</span>
   <span id="f000315">then,</span>
   <span id="f000316">I don’t see that there is any mystery about it,</span>
   <span id="f000317">after all.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000318">A.</span>
   <span id="f000319">You don’t?</span>
   <span id="f000320">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000321">I do.</span>
   <span id="f000322">Anyway,</span>
   <span id="f000323">I don’t see how they could ever have been such a blundering lot as to go and bury the wrong child.</span>
   <span id="f000324">But,</span>
   <span id="f000325">’sh!</span>
   <span id="f000326">– don’t mention it where the family can hear of it.</span>
   <span id="f000327">Heaven knows they have heartbreaking troubles enough without adding this.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000328">Q.</span>
   <span id="f000329">Well,</span>
   <span id="f000330">I believe I have got material enough for the present,</span>
   <span id="f000331">and I am very much obliged to you for the pains you have taken.</span>
   <span id="f000332">But I was a good deal interested in that account of Aaron Burr’s funeral.</span>
   <span id="f000333">Would you mind telling me what particular circumstance it was that made you think Burr was such a remarkable man?</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000334">A.</span>
   <span id="f000335">Oh!</span>
   <span id="f000336">it was a mere trifle!</span>
   <span id="f000337">Not one man in fifty would have noticed it at all.</span>
   <span id="f000338">When the sermon was over,</span>
   <span id="f000339">and the procession all ready to start for the cemetery,</span>
   <span id="f000340">and the body all arranged nice in the hearse,</span>
   <span id="f000341">he said he wanted to take a last look at the scenery,</span>
   <span id="f000342">and so he got up and rode with the driver.</span></p>
   <p><span id="f000343">Then the young man reverently withdrew.</span>
   <span id="f000344">He was very pleasant company,</span>
   <span id="f000345">and I was sorry to see him go.</span></p>
