   <h1 class="chapterTitle"><span id="f000001">Introduction</span></h1> 
   <p><span id="f000002">I suppose that of all the stories I have ever written this one cost me the least travail and perhaps gave me the most amusement.</span> 
    <span id="f000003">As to the labor involved,</span> 
    <span id="f000004">it was written during one day in the city of New Orleans,</span> 
    <span id="f000005">with the express purpose of buying a platinum and diamond wrist watch which cost six hundred dollars.</span> 
    <span id="f000006">I began it at seven in the morning and finished it at two o’clock the same night.</span> 
    <span id="f000007">It was published in the «Saturday Evening Post» in 1920,</span> 
    <span id="f000008">and later included in the O.&#160;Henry Memorial Collection for the same year.</span> 
    <span id="f000009">I like it least of all the stories in this volume.</span></p> 
   <p><span id="f000010">My amusement was derived from the fact that the camel part of the story is literally true;</span> 
    <span id="f000011">in fact,</span> 
    <span id="f000012">I have a standing engagement with the gentleman involved to attend the next fancy-dress party to which we are mutually invited,</span> 
    <span id="f000013">attired as the latter part of the camel —</span> 
    <span id="f000014">this as a sort of atonement for being his historian.</span></p>
